\section{$\scl{P_1}{P_2}=0, \quad \scl{P_2}{P_2}=0, \quad \scl{P_4}{P_4}=0$}
\label{sez2tgA}

Let $P_1, \dots, P_5$ be such that $P_1, P_2, P_3$ are aligned,
$P_1, P_4, P_5$ are aligned and the line $P_1+P_2$ and the line
$P_1+P_4$ are tangent to the isotropic conic, hence
the conditions satisfied by the points (((*v. lemma che dice che
una retta tg in P2 a conica isotropa sse (P1|P2)=(P2|P2)=0*))) are:
\[
\scl{P_1}{P_2}=0, \quad \scl{P_2}{P_2}=0, \quad \scl{P_4}{P_4}=0
\]
The point $P_1$ cannot be on the isotropic conic, hence, using the
action of $\mathrm{SO}_3(\mathbb{C})$, we can assume $P_1 = (1, 0, 0)$.
Since every element of $\mathrm{SO}_3(\mathbb{C})$ fixes the
isotropic conic and send a tangent line to it into another 
tangent line to it, when we transform the point $P_1$
into $(1, 0, 0)$, we transform the points $P_2$ and $P_4$ into, respectively,
the points $(0, i, 1)$ and $(0, -i, 1)$ (which are the common points to
the isotropic conic and the tangent lines through $P_1$).
Therefore it is enough to study the
specific configuration of the points given by:
\[
P_1 = (1, 0, 0), \quad P_2=(0, i, 1), \quad P_3=u_1P_1+u_2P_2, \quad
P_4= (0, -i, 1), \quad P_5 = v_1P_1+v_2P_4.
\]
It is immediate to see that $\delta_2(P_1, P_2, P_3, P_4, P_5) = 0$.
In the $15\times 10$ matrix $\Phi_M(P_1, \dots, P_5)$ we can erase the
rows: $\phi_2(P_1)$ (which is a zero row), the row $\phi_1(P_2)$
(since $\phi_1(P_2)=i\phi_2(P_2)$) and, for similar reasons, the
rows: $\phi_1(P_3)$, $\phi_1(P_4)$ and $\phi_1(P_5)$. 
Moreover, since the rank of the matrix $\Phi_M(P_1, P_2, P_3)$ is $5$,
we can also erase the row $\phi_3(P_3)$ and, for the same reason, the
row $\phi_3(P_5)$. The remaining matrix $M$ is a $8\times 10$ matrix whose rank
in general is $8$. It is not possible to have that all the order $8$ minors
of $M$ are zero, since this condition implies that the five points
are not all distinct.

Hence we have proved:

\begin{prop}
Let $P_1, P_2, P_3$ three aligned points and let also $P_1, P_4, P_5$
be aligned and assume that
\[
\scl{P_1}{P_2}=0, \quad \scl{P_2}{P_2}=0, \quad \scl{P_4}{P_4}=0
\]
Then the matrix $\Phi_M(P_1, P_2, P_3, P_4, P_5)$ has rank $8$.
\label{frecciaFissata}
\end{prop}

Since it seems to hold:
\begin{prop}
  Let $P_1, P_2, P_3$ be three distinct collinear points of the
  plane and let $Q$ be a point
  in the plane. If the matrix $\Phi_M(P_1, P_2, P_3, Q)$ has rank $\leq 7$,
  then the line $P_1+P_2$ is tangent to the isotropic conic in the point
  $P_1$ (or $P_2$ or $P_3$). In particular, the matrix $\Phi_M(P_1, P_2, P_3)$
  has rank $5$.
  \label{condition3+1}
\end{prop}

the above results allow to prove the following:

\begin{prop}
  Let $P_1, P_2, P_3$ three aligned points and let also $P_1, P_4, P_5$
  be aligned. Then the matrix $\Phi_M(P_1, P_2, P_3, P_4, P_5)$ cannot
  have rank $\leq 7$. 
\end{prop}
\begin{proof}
  If the above matrix has rank $\leq 7$, in particular we have that
  the matrix $\Phi_M(P_1, P_2, P_3, P_4)$ has rank $\leq 7$ hence, from 
  proposition~\ref{condition3+1}, we get the line $P_1+P_2$ is
  tangent to the isotropic conic in one of the points $P_1, P_2, P_3$.
  Similarly, also the line $P_1+P_4$ is tangent to the isotropic conic
  in one of the points $P_1, P_4, P_5$. Hence the points are such that
  $P_1$ is not on the isotropic conic and the lines $P_1+P_2$ and
  $P_1+P_4$ are tangent to the conic in the points $P_2$ and $P_4$.
  Hence the configuration of the points is the configuration described
  in proposition~\ref{frecciaFissata} so the rank of the matrix
  considered in this proposition cannot be $\leq 7$. 
\end{proof}


We consider again the case
\[
P_1 = (1, 0, 0), P_2 = (0, i, 1), P_4 = (0, -i, 1), P_3 = u_1P_1+u_2P_2,
P_5 = v_1P_1+v_2P_2
\]
The matrix $\Phi(P_1, ..., P_5)$, 
after some manipulations, is the following rank 8 matrix:
\begin{equation}
\left(\begin{array}{rrrrrrrrrr}
0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & -1 & 0 & 0 & 1 \\
0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & 0 & -1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & -1 & 0 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
0 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
-3 u_{1} & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 2 u_{2} & 2 u_{1} & 2 \mathit{ii} u_{2} & 0 \\
-3 v_{1} & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 2 v_{2} & 2 v_{1} & -2 \mathit{ii} v_{2} & 0
\end{array}\right)
\label{matriceBella}
\end{equation}
Solving the system with Cramer, we get a one dimensional linear system
$\mathcal{C}(l_1, l_2) = l_1\mathcal{C}_1+l_2\mathcal{C}_2$ of cubic
curves generated by:

\begin{eqnarray}
  \mathcal{C}_1 & = & x \cdot \left(x^{2} + \frac{3}{2} y^{2} +
\frac{3}{2} z^{2}\right)\\
  \mathcal{C}_2 & = & (y + \mathit{ii} z) \cdot (y - \mathit{ii} z) \cdot (y u_{2} v_{1} - \mathit{ii} z u_{2} v_{1} - y u_{1} v_{2} - \mathit{ii} z u_{1} v_{2} + 2 \mathit{ii} x u_{2} v_{2})  \nonumber
\label{famigliaCubDim1}
\end{eqnarray}

The eigenpoints of the curve $\mathcal{C}_1$
are the two lines $P_1+P_2$ and $P_1+P_4$ and the point $P_1$.
We assume therefore $l_2 \not= 0$ (and obviously
$u_1, u_2, v_1, v_2$ different from zero, too) and we get that the cubics
$C(l_1, l_2)$ have 7
eigenpoints, five are clearly $P_1, \dots, P_5$,
the remaining two are given by an ideal $J$, one of whose gererators is the
polynomial:
\[
yu_2v_1 + (-ii)zu_2v_1 + yu_1v_2 + (ii)zu_1v_2
\]
which is linear in $x, y, z$ (does not depend on $l_1$ or $l_2$)
and is the equation of the line passing
through the point $P_1$ and orthogonal to the line $P_3+P_5$. In particular,
we get that the three eigenpoints $P_1$, $P_6$ and $P_7$ are collinear.
In general, there are no other collinearities among the points (indeed, if
$P_6$ (or $P_7$) were aligned with two of the other points, its coordinates
would be rationals in the parameters and the ideal $J$ would split
into the two ideals of the points $P_6$ and $P_7$).


Now we consider the one dimensional linear system of cubics given
by~(\ref{famigliaCubDim1}) and we want to see if, for some positions
of the points $P_3$ and $P_5$ we can have further collinearities.

Siamo arrivati al punto 12341231234 del file contiCasoDegenere2.sage


\textbf{Case 1.} We want to see when $P_2, P_4$ and $P_6$ are aligned. 
In this case we get the following coordinates for $P_6$ and $P_7$:

\begin{eqnarray*}
P_6 & = & \left(0, -\mathit{ii}u_2v_1 + \mathit{ii}u_1v_2, 
-u_2v_1 - u_1v_2\right)\\
P_7 & = & \left(3\mathit{ii}u_1v_1, -u_2v_1 + u_1v_2,
\mathit{ii}u_2v_1 + \mathit{ii}u_1v_2\right)
\end{eqnarray*}

In this case we have the four alignments $(P_1, P_2, P_3)$, $(P_1, P_4, P_5)$,
$(P_1, P_6, P_7)$ and $(P_2, P_4, P_6)$ and the following orthogonalities
of the points:
\[
\scl{P_1}{P_2} = \scl{P_1}{P_4} = \scl{P_1}{P_6} = 
\scl{P_2}{P_2} = \scl{P_2}{P_3} = \scl{P_4}{P_4} = 
\scl{P_4}{P_5} = 0
\]
Furthermore, here we have the orthogonalities of the lines containing
the points:
\[
\begin{array}{l}
(P_1+P_2) \perp (P_1+P_2), \ (P_1+P_2) \perp (P_2+P_5), \
  (P_1+P_4) \perp (P_1+P_4), \\
  (P_1+P_4) \perp (P_3+P_4), \ (P_1+P_6) \perp (P_3+P_5)
\end{array}
  \]
If the eigenpoints are distinct, there are no possibilities to have 
configurations with further collinearities.

\textbf{Case 2.} If we impose the collinearities of the points
$P_2$, $P_5$ and $P_6$, we get that also the points $P_3, P_4, P_5$ and
the points $P_3, P_5, P_7$ are aligned. The orthogonalities of the
points and of the lines of the previous case are the same.

The same collinearities are obtained if we impose the only condition
that $P_3, P_5, P_7$ are aligned. Hence we have that, when the family of
cubic curves given by~\ref{famigliaCubDim1} have seven distinct
eigenpoints,  the possible alignments are either those of fig (3),
or fig (5) or fig (8). The line $P_3+P_5$ is orthogonal to the line $P_1+P_6$.

\section{$\sigma_{12} = 0, \sigma_{14} = 0$}
We consider now the case in which the five eigenpoints $P_1, \dots, P_5$
are such that the line $P_1+P_2$ and the line $P_1+P_4$ are tangent to the
isotropic conic (but the tangent points are not $P_2$ and $P_4$ as in
section~\ref{sez2tgA}), i.e. here we consider the case
\[
\sigma(P_1, P_2) = 0, \quad \sigma(P_1, P_4) = 0
\]
The result is:
\begin{prop}
In case $\sigma(P_1, P_2) = 0, \sigma(P_1, P_4) = 0$, if at most 
one of the points $P_2, P_3, P_4, P_5$ is on the isotropic conic, then
the rank of the matrix $\Phi(P_1, \dots, P_5)$ is $9$ and cannot be
less then $9$. Then there is only one cubic curve solution of the system
whose matrix is $\Phi()$, the cubic is reducible and the eigenpoints are
the two tangent lines throught $P_1$ and the point $P_1$.
\end{prop}

To perform the computations, we assume:
$Q_2, Q_4 = (0: \mathit{ii}: 1), (0: -\mathit{ii}: 1)$.
\begin{gather}
P_1, P_2, P_3 = (1:0:0), u_1P_1+u_2Q_2, v_1P_1+v_2Q_2, \nonumber \\
P_4, P_5 = w_1P_1+w_2Q_4, l_1P_1+l_2Q_4\nonumber
\end{gather}
where we assume $u_2, v_1, v_2, w_1, w_2, l_1, l_2$ not zero but we accept
that $u_1$ could be zero (since we want to consider among the possible
cases, the case in which one of the two tangent lines to the isotropic
conic is tangent in an eigenpoint). In this situation the rank of the
matrix $\Phi(P_1, P_2, P_3, P_4, P_5)$ cannot be less then $9$.

The study of the cubic curves which have among the eigenpoints
the points $P_1, \dots, P_5$ shows that in this case the cubic curves
with $P_1, \dots, P_5$ as eigenpoints are always the cubic
\[
x(x^2 + 3/2y^2 + 3/2z^2)
\]
and this cubic has the lines $P_1+P_2$ and $P_1+P_4$ and the point $P_1$ as
eigenpoints (see above).
