\section{Introduction}
\label{introduction}

However, there are several examples of cubic polynomials, whose eigenscheme contains one or more triples of aligned points, as for instance the Fermat cubic polynomial.

The goal of this paper is to classify all the situations when we have one or more triples of aligned points inside a zero-dimensional reduced eigenscheme of a cubic plane curve.

\Cref{aligned} clarifies the reasons of interest in the situation of triples of aligned eigenpoints.


\section{Aligned eigenpoints of ternary cubic form}
\label{aligned}

We recall that, given a homogeneous form $f \in \C[x,y,z]_d$ of degree~$d$, the eigenscheme~$\Eig{f}$ of~$f$ is the determinantal scheme defined by the $2 \times 2$ minors of the matrix
%
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:def_matrix}
    \begin{pmatrix}
    x & y & z \\
    \de_x f & \de_y f & \de_z f
    \end{pmatrix}.
\end{equation}
%
Since the eigenschemes of two proportional homogenous forms are the same,
if $C$ is the curve defined by these forms,
we can write $\Eig{C}$ for such eigenscheme and hence talk about the eigenscheme of a plane curve.

The eigenscheme of a general ternary cubic form has no aligned triples of points. This is a consequence of the geometric properties of the classical Geiser map associated with seven points in the plane, and has been proved in \cite[Proposition~4.5]{BGV}.

Moreover, whenever the eigenscheme of a ternary form is zero-dimensional, it never cointains $4$ or more aligned points.
To see this, we recall a property of eigenschemes of ternary forms, namely,
that when zero-dimensional they are somehow ``general'' with respect to conics.

\begin{lemma}
\label{lemma:no_six_conic}
Let $f \in \C[x,y,z]_d$ be a homogeneous form of degree~$d$.
If $E(f)$ is zero-dimensional,
then no degree six subscheme of~$E(f)$ lies on a conic.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
See \cite[Lemma~9.1]{OS1} for the reduced case.
The proof works also in the non-reduced case.
\end{proof}

\begin{corollary}
\label{corollary:general_no_triple}
As a consequence of \Cref{lemma:no_six_conic}, a zero-dimensional eigenscheme~$\Eig{f}$ for $f \in \C[x,y,z]_d$ never contains $4$ or more aligned points.
Moreover, if $\Eig{f}$ contains two triples of aligned points, those must share a point.
\end{corollary}

Therefore, we investigate the situations when we have one or more triples of aligned eigenpoints in a zero-dimensional, reduced eigenscheme of a ternary cubic form.

\section{Invariance under the action of orthogonal matrices}
\label{invariance}

\begin{definition}
 We define $\mathrm{SO}_3(\mathbb{C})$ to be the complexification of the group of special orthogonal real matrices, namely
 %
 \[
  \mathrm{SO}_3(\mathbb{C}) :=
  \bigl\{
   M \in \mathrm{GL}_3(\C) \, \mid \,
   M M^t = I_3 \  \text{and} \  \det(M) = 1
  \bigr\} \,.
 \]
 %
 The group $\mathrm{SO}_3(\mathbb{C})$ acts on $\C^3$ by matrix multiplication:
 %
 \[
  \begin{array}{ccc}
   \mathrm{SO}_3(\mathbb{C}) \times \C^3 & \rightarrow & \C^3 \\
   (M, v) & \mapsto & Mv
  \end{array}
 \]
 %
 Since all the elements of $\mathrm{SO}_3(\mathbb{C})$ are invertible, the latter action descends to an action on $\p^2(\C)$.

 Moreover, the group~$\mathrm{SO}_3(\mathbb{C})$ acts also on ternary forms via
 \[
  M \cdot f (x,y,z) = f(M^{-1} \cdot \prescript{t} {}( x \ y \ z )  ).
 \]
\end{definition}

\begin{prop}
\label{two_orbits}
 The action of $\mathrm{SO}_3(\mathbb{C})$ on $\p^2(\C)$ has two orbits:
 %
 \begin{align*}
  \mathcal{O}_1 &:=
  \bigl\{
   P \in \p^2(\C) \, | \,
   P = (a:b:c) \  \text{with} \  a^2 + b^2 + c^2 = 0
  \bigr\} \\
  \mathcal{O}_2 &:= \p^2(\C) \setminus \mathcal{O}_1
 \end{align*}
 %
 A representative for $\mathcal{O}_1$ is $(1:\iii:0)$ and a
representative for $\mathcal{O}_2$ is $(1:0:0)$.
\end{prop}
\begin{proof}
 Suppose that $P \in \p^2(\C)$ and $P = (a:b:c)$ with $a^2 + b^2 + c^2 = 0$.
 We produce a matrix $M \in \mathrm{SO}_3(\C)$ such that $M \left(\begin{smallmatrix} 1 \\ \iii \\ 0 \end{smallmatrix}\right)$ and $\left(\begin{smallmatrix} a \\ b \\ c \end{smallmatrix}\right)$ are proportional.
 Up to relabeling the coordinates, we can suppose that $a \neq 0$.
 Hence, by rescaling the coordinates of $P$, we have $P = (1: b: c)$ with $b^2 + c^2 = -1$.
 One can check that the matrix
 %
 \[
  M :=
  \begin{pmatrix}
   -1 & 0 & 0 \\
   0 & \iii b & -\iii c \\
   0 & \iii c & \iii b
  \end{pmatrix}
 \]
 %
 satisfies the requirements.

 Now suppose that $P \in \p^2(\C)$ and $P = (a:b:c)$ with $a^2 + b^2 + c^2 \neq 0$.
 Up to rescaling, we can suppose that $a^2 + b^2 + c^2 = 1$.
 Again, we produce a matrix $M \in \mathrm{SO}_3(\C)$ such that $M \left(\begin{smallmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \\ 0 \end{smallmatrix}\right)$ and $\left(\begin{smallmatrix} a \\ b \\ c \end{smallmatrix}\right)$ are proportional.
 First of all, suppose that $b^2 + c^2 \neq 0$ and let $\omega$ be a root of the polynomial $t^2 - (b^2 + c^2)$ in $\C[t]$.
 Then, the matrix
 %
 \[
   M :=
   \begin{pmatrix}
     a & \omega & 0 \\
     b & -\frac{ab}{\omega} & \frac{c}{\omega} \\
     c & -\frac{ac}{\omega} & -\frac{b}{\omega}
   \end{pmatrix}
 \]
 %
 satisfies the requirements.
 With the same technique, if $a^2 + c^2 \neq 0$, we can produce a matrix $M \in \mathrm{SO}_3(\C)$ that maps $\left(\begin{smallmatrix} 0 \\ 1 \\ 0 \end{smallmatrix}\right)$ to $\left(\begin{smallmatrix} a \\ b \\ c \end{smallmatrix}\right)$; similarly, when $a^2 + b^2 \neq 0$, we can map $\left(\begin{smallmatrix} 0 \\ 0 \\ 1 \end{smallmatrix}\right)$ to $\left(\begin{smallmatrix} a \\ b \\ c \end{smallmatrix}\right)$.
 Since $\left(\begin{smallmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \\ 0 \end{smallmatrix}\right)$, $\left(\begin{smallmatrix} 0 \\ 1 \\ 0 \end{smallmatrix}\right)$, and $\left(\begin{smallmatrix} 0 \\ 0 \\ 1 \end{smallmatrix}\right)$ are all $\mathrm{SO}_3(\C)$-equivalent, the only case to consider is when
 %
 \[
  b^2 + c^2 = a^2 + c^2 = a^2 + b^2 = 0 \,,
 \]
 %
 which, however, can never occur.
\end{proof}

The following result is well known; we recall it for the sake of completeness.

\begin{prop}
 Let $M \in \mathrm{GL}_3(\C)$ and let $f$ be a ternary cubic.
 Let $P = (A: B: C)$ be a point in~$\p^2$.
 Then we have
 \[
  P \in \Eig{f} \iff M \cdot \prescript{t} {}(A \ B \ C) \in \Eig{M \cdot f}.
 \]
\end{prop}

\begin{proof}
In the present proof,
for convenience, we shall consider the transpose of the defining matrix of an eigenscheme.

A point $P = (A: B: C)$ is an eigenpoint for~$f$ if and only if
\begin{equation*}
  \text  {rk}  \begin{pmatrix}
    A & \de_x f(P) \\
    B & \de_y f(P)  \\
    C & \de_z f(P)
    \end{pmatrix}=1,
\end{equation*}
which is equivalent to
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:def_matrix_M}
    \text  {rk} \quad  M  \cdot \begin{pmatrix}
    A & \de_x f(P) \\
    B & \de_y f(P)  \\
    C & \de_z f(P)
    \end{pmatrix}
    =1.
\end{equation}
By setting $\prescript{t} {}(A' \ B' \ C' )= M \cdot \prescript{t} {}(A \ B \ C) $ and $Q=(A':B':C')$, we have that \Cref{eq:def_matrix_M}
is equivalent to
%
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:transformed}
  \rk 
  \begin{pmatrix}
    A' &  \\
    B' & M \cdot \nabla f (P) \\
    C' & \\
  \end{pmatrix}=1.
\end{equation}
%
Now we consider the polynomial $M \cdot f$ and we observe that the chain rule gives
%
\begin{gather*}
\partial_x (M\cdot f) = \partial_x \bigl( f(M^{-1}  \ \prescript{t} {} (x \ y \ z)) \bigr) = \prescript{t} {}(M^{-1})^{(1)}(\nabla f) \bigl( M^{-1}\   \prescript{t} {} (x \ y \ z) \bigr) \,, \\
\partial_y (M\cdot f) = \partial_y \bigl( f(M^{-1}  \ \prescript{t} {} (x \ y \ z)) \bigr) = \prescript{t} {}(M^{-1})^{(2)}(\nabla f) \bigl( M^{-1}\   \prescript{t} {} (x \ y \ z) \bigr) \,, \\
\partial_z (M\cdot f) = \partial_z  \bigl( f(M^{-1}  \ \prescript{t} {} (x \ y \ z)) \bigr) = \prescript{t} {}(M^{-1})^{(3)}(\nabla f) \bigl( M^{-1}\   \prescript{t} {} (x \ y \ z) \bigr) \,,
\end{gather*}
%
where $(M^{-1})^{(j)}$ denotes the $j$-th column of the matrix $M^{-1}$. Hence
%
\[
\nabla (M \cdot f) = \prescript{t} {} M^{-1} \cdot (\nabla f) (M^{-1}\   \prescript{t} {} (x \ y \ z)),
\]
%
so we have
%
\[
\nabla (M \cdot f)(Q)=\nabla (M \cdot f)(M \cdot P)=
\prescript{t} {} M^{-1} \cdot (\nabla f) (M^{-1}\   M \cdot P)=\prescript{t} {} M^{-1} \cdot (\nabla f)(P).
\]
%
Finally, if we choose $M \in \mathrm{SO}_3(\mathbb{C})$, we have
$\prescript{t} {} M^{-1}=M$. We deduce that
\Cref{eq:transformed} holds if and only if $Q \in E(M\cdot f)$, so the statement is proved.
\end{proof}

\section{Conditions imposed by aligned eigenpoints}
\label{conditions}

Imposing a cubic ternary form to have one or more aligned triples of eigenschemes implies conditions both on the points and on the cubics.
We begin to explore these conditions by introducing, for each point
$P \in \p^2$,
a $3 \times 10$ matrix encoding the condition that $P$ is an eigenpoint of a ternary cubic.

\begin{definition}
\label{definition:matrix_conditions}
 Consider $\p^9 = \p(\C[x,y,z]_3)$, the space of all ternary cubics.
 Throught this paper, we fix the following vector basis for $\C[x,y,z]_3$:
 \begin{eqnarray}
  \mathcal{B} = (x^3, x^2 y, x y^2, y^3, x^2 z, x y z, y^2 z, x z^2, y z^2, z^3)
  \label{vector_basis}
 \end{eqnarray}
 For $f \in \C[x,y,z]_3$, denote by $[f]$ the corresponding point in~$\p^9$; we denote by $w_f$ the (column) vector of coordinates of~$f$ with respect to the basis above; then $w_f$ is also a vector of projective coordinates of~$[f]$.
 For a point $P \in \p^2$ with coordinates $(A: B: C)$, the condition on elements~$[f]$ of~$\p^9$ that $P$ is an eigenpoint of the ternary cubic form~$f$ can be expressed in the form
 %
 \[
  \Phi(P) \cdot w_f
  = 0 \,,
 \]
 %
 where $\Phi(P)$ is a $3 \times 10$ matrix with entries depending on $A, B, C$.
 The matrix $\Phi(P)$ is called the \emph{matrix of conditions} imposed by~$P$.
We denote by $\phi_1(P)$, $\phi_2(P)$, and~$\phi_3(P)$ the rows of~$\Phi(P)$.
Written as vectors, they are
%
\begin{equation}
\label{equation:matrix_conditions_rows}
\begin{gathered}
\scalemath{0.9}{(-3A^2B, A(A^2 - 2B^2), B(2A^2 - B^2), 3AB^2,
 -2ABC, C(A^2 - B^2), 2 ABC,
 -B  C^2, A  C^2, 0)} \,, \\
\scalemath{0.9}{(-3A^2 C,
-2ABC,
-CB^2,
0,
A(A^2-2C^2),
B(A^2 - C^2),
AB^2,
C(2A^2-C^2),
2ABC,
3AC^2)} \,,\\
\scalemath{0.9}{(0,
-A^2C,
-2ABC,
-3CB^2,
A^2 B,
A(B^2 - C^2),
B(B^2-2C^2),
2ABC,
C(2B^2-C^2),
3BC^2)} \,.
\end{gathered}
\end{equation}
%
Moreover, if $P_1, \dotsc, P_n$ are points in the plane, we denote by $\Phi(P_1, \dotsc, P_n)$ the matrix
%
\[
 \left(
 \begin{array}{c}
  \Phi(P_1) \\
  \vdots \\
  \Phi(P_n)
 \end{array}
 \right)
\]
%
namely, the $3n \times 10$ matrix obtained by vertically stacking the matrices of conditions of~$P_1, \dotsc, P_n$.
\end{definition}

\begin{rmk} @@si puo' dire meglio, usando le derivate parziali@@)
By analyzing the entries of \Cref{equation:matrix_conditions_rows}, it is not difficult to check that the rank of
$\Phi(P)$ is never $\leq 1$.
Moreover, it holds:
\begin{equation}
  C \, \phi_1(P) - B \, \phi_2(P) + A \, \phi_3(P) = 0,
  \label{eq:base}
\end{equation}
therefore,
among the three vectors, at most two of them are linearly independent.
Hence, the matrix~$\Phi(P)$ has rank~$2$.
\end{rmk}

As a consequence, if $P_1, \dots, P_n$ are $n$ points of the plane, we have:
\begin{equation}
\label{bound_rank}
\rk  \  \Phi(P_1, \dots, P_n) \leq \min \left\{2n, 10 \right\}
\end{equation}

In what follows we want to study the possible values of the rank of the matrix
$\Phi(P_1, \dots, P_n)$ for several configurations of points $P_1, \dots, P_n$
(and several values of $n$).
In particular, we will study the ideal~$J_k$ of order $k$ minors of the
involved matrix and we will deduce some bounds about the rank from the possible
decompositions of the ideal~$J_k$. Most of these computations will be done
with the aid of a computer algebra system. Nevertheless, in many cases,
the result cannot be reached just by brute force, but it is necessary to
make some preprocessing on the ideal~$J_k$. In particular, it turns out that
it is often convenient to first saturate the ideal~$J_k$ with respect to
the conditions that the
points are distinct or that three of them are not aligned (when this is the
case). Another important simplification that we adopt sometimes, makes use
of the action of $\SO_3(\C)$: thanks to it we can assume that one of
the point is either $(1: 0: 0)$ or $(1: \iii: 0)$; see \Cref{two_orbits}.

Finally, several times the following lemma will be extremely useful
to speed up the computations.

\begin{lemma}
\label{lemma:minors}
Let $l_1 < \cdots <l_n$ be $n$ indices (where $3 \leq n \leq 10$) and let $P = (A: B: C)$ be a point of the plane.
Construct three $1 \times n$ matrices $w_1$, $w_2$, $w_3$ by extracting the entries of position $l_1, \dotsc, l_n$ from $\phi_1(P)$, $\phi_2(P)$, and~$\phi_3(P)$, respectively. If $L$ is a $(n-2) \times n$ matrix, set:
  \[
  L_1 := \left(\begin{array}{c}w_1 \\ w_2 \\ L\end{array}  \right), \quad
  L_2 := \left(\begin{array}{c}w_1 \\ w_3 \\ L\end{array}  \right), \quad
  L_3 := \left(\begin{array}{c}w_2 \\ w_3 \\ L\end{array}  \right)
  \]
  Then
  \[
  B \det(L_1) = A \det(L_2), \quad
  C \det(L_1) = A \det(L_3), \quad
  C \det(L_2) = B \det(L_3)
  \]
  hence $(A: B: C) = \bigl( \det(L_1): \det(L_2): \det(L_3) \bigr)$.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
  The thesis easily follows from the equality $C w_1 - B w_2 + A w_3 = 0$, which is a direct consequence of \Cref{eq:base}.
\end{proof}

\begin{definition}
 \label{definition:reduced_matrix_conditions}
 For $n$ points $P_1, \dotsc, P_n$ in the plane, the \emph{reduced matrix of conditions} of $P_1, \dotsc, P_n$ is the submatrix of~$\Phi(P_1, \dotsc, P_n)$ whose rows are $\phi_1(P_1), \phi_2(P_1), \dotsc, \phi_1(P_n), \phi_2(P_n)$.
\end{definition}


% \begin{lemma}
%   \label{lemma_for_minors2}
%   Let $P(A: B: C)$, $Q(A': B': C')$ be two points of $\mathbb{P}^2_K$
%   and set $R = \alpha P+\beta Q$ (where $\alpha, \beta \in K$).
%   Suppose $l_1 < \cdots < l_n$ are as above, fix $j \in \{1, 2, 3\}$
%   and   let $w_1$ be the vector obtained
%   from the entries of $\phi_j(P)$ of position $l_1, \dots, l_n$
%   and $w_2$ be the vector analogously obtained from $R$. If
%   $L$ is a square matrix which contains the
%   rows $w_1$ and $w_2$, then $\alpha\beta$ divides $\det(L)$.
% \end{lemma}
% \begin{proof}
%   We consider $\det(L)$ as a polynomial in $\alpha$.
%   If we set $\alpha = 0$,
%   we have that $w_1$ and $w_2$ are proportional, so, if $\alpha = 0$
%   then $\det(L)$ is $0$. Hence $\alpha$ divides $\det(L)$. Same
%   argument for $\beta$.
% \end{proof}


First of all, we point out a property of the lines, which are tangent to~$\iso$.
Let $P_1, P_2$ be two distinct points in the plane and define
%
\[
  \sigma(P_1, P_2) := \scl{P_1}{P_1} \scl{P_2}{P_2} - \scl{P_1}{P_2}^2 \,.
\]
%
The quantity~$\sigma$ is the discriminant of the intersection between the line~$r$ through~$P_1$ and~$P_2$ and~$\iso$.

\begin{prop}
\label{proposition:sigma_tangency}
  Let $P_1$, $P_2$ be two distinct points in the plane and let $r$ be the line joining them.
  Then the following are equivalent:
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item $\sigma(P_1, P_2) = 0$;
  \item $\sigma(Q_1, Q_2) = 0$ for all pairs of distinct points $Q_1, Q_2 \in r$;
  \item the line $r$ is tangent to~$\iso$ at some point;
  \item there exists a point $T \in r$ such that  $T \in \iso$ and $\scl{T}{Q} = 0$ for all $Q \in r$, $Q \neq T$; in this case we say that $T$ is \emph{orthogonal} to $r$.
  \end{enumerate}
\end{prop}
\begin{proof}
  By recalling the characterization of~$\sigma$ as a discriminant, we have that $\sigma(P_1, P_2) = 0$ if and only if $r$ is tangent to~$\iso$ in a point~$T$; this shows that the first three items are equivalent.

  Now, if $\sigma(P_1, P_2) = 0$, then $r$ is tangent to~$\iso$ at a point~$T$, hence $\scl{T}{T} = 0$. Moreover, we also have that $\sigma(T, Q) = 0$ for all $Q \in r$ with $Q \neq T$. Hence, $T$ is orthogonal to~$r$.
  The converse is immediate.
\end{proof}

\begin{prop}
\label{proposition:three_aligned_ranks}
Let $P_1, P_2, P_3$ be three distinct aligned points of the plane and let
$r$ be the line passing through them. Then:
\begin{itemize}
\item $5 \leq \rk \ \Phi(P_1, P_2, P_3) \leq 6$;
\item
$\rk \ \Phi(P_1, P_2, P_3) = 5$ if and only if $r$ is tangent
to~$\iso$ in one of the three points $P_1, P_2$, or $P_3$.
\end{itemize}
\end{prop}
\begin{proof} We denote the coordinates of the points as follows:
\[
P_1, P_2, P_3 = (A_1: B_1: C_1), (A_2: B_2: C_2), u_1P_1+u_2P_2.
\]
We have to consider the ideal generated by the $17640$ order six
minors of the matrix $\Phi(P_1, P_2, P_3)$ and we
claim that we can greately simplify
the computations.

Consider the matrix $M$ constructed with the following six rows:
\[
\phi_{i_1}(P_1), \ \phi_{i_2}(P_1), \ \phi_{j_1}(P_2),\  \phi_{j_2}(P_2),
\phi_{k_1}(P_3), \ \phi_{k_2}(P_3)
\]
where $i_1 \not= i_2 \in \{1, 2, 3\}$; $j_1 \not= j_2 \in \{1, 2, 3\}$;
$k_1 \not= k_2 \in \{1, 2, 3\}$.
First, assume that $i_1=j_1=k_1=1$ and
$i_2=j_2=k_2=2$. Fix six columns
$1\leq l_1 < \cdots l_6 \leq 10$ of $M$ and let $N$ be the order $6$ matrix
obtained from $M$ with these columns. Since two rows of $N$ are obtained from
entries of $\phi_1(P_1)$ and of $\phi_2(P_1)$,
\Cref{lemma:minors} gives that $A_1$ divides $\det(N)$. For a similar
reason, also $A_2$ and $u_1A_1+u_2A_2$ divide $\det(N)$, so
$\det(N) = A_1A_2(u_1A_1+u_2A_2)\cdot D$ for a suitable $D$.
Again by \Cref{lemma:minors}, we also see that if we take different values of
$i_1, i_2, j_1, j_2, k_1, k_2$ in the definition of $M$ above, then
the corresponding $\det(N)$ would be of the form $X_1X_2X_3\cdot D$ where
$X_1$ is a coordinate of $P_1$, $X_2$ is a coordinate of $P_2$ and $X_3$ is
a coordinate of $P_3$ (and $D$ is the same as above). Since each of the three
points have at least one non-zero coordinate, if the order six minor
constructed with the columns $l_1, \dots, l_6$ is zero, then necessarily $D$
must be zero. In this way we see that, in order to have that all the order
six minors of $\Phi(P_1, P_2, P_3)$ are zero, it is enough to compute the
ideal of the order six minors of the matrix $M$ above and divide each
minor by $A_1A_2(u_1A_1+u_2A_2)$. By this procedure, we get an ideal that (after
a saturation w.r.t.\ the condition that $P_1$, $P_2$, and $P_1, P_3$ and
$P_2$, $P_3$ are distinct), has
a very simple primary decomposition, which is given by the following three
ideals:
\[
\left(\scl{P_i}{P_1}, \scl{P_i}{P_2},\scl{P_i}{P_3}\right) \quad
\mbox{for } i = 1, 2, 3 \,.
\]
As a consequence, the line $r$ is tangent to~$\iso$
(in $P_1$ or $P_2$ or $P_3$).
It is not difficult to see via a symbolic computation that it is not possible to have that all the order
$4$-minors of $\Phi(P_1, P_2, P_3)$ are zero.
\end{proof}

\begin{prop}
\label{manca il riferimento su ancillary    non e': condition_rank_aligned}

Let $P_1, P_2, P_4$ be three distinct points of the plane. Then:
\begin{itemize}
\item $5 \leq \rk \ \Phi(P_1, P_2, P_4) \leq 6$;
\item if
$\rk \ \Phi(P_1, P_2, P_4) = 5$, then $P_1, P_2, P_4$
 are aligned.
\end{itemize}
In the last case, the line $P_1+P_2+P_4$ is tangent to~$\iso$
in one of the three points.
\end{prop}
\begin{proof}
We can split the proof into two parts, considering the case in
which $P_4 = (1: 0: 0)$ and the case in which $P_4 = (1: \iii: 0)$.
In both cases, che computation of the ideal of order five minors of the matrix
$\Phi(P_1, P_2, P_4)$ and the saturation of it w.r.t.\ the condition
that the points $P_1, P_2, P_4$ are distinct gives the whole ring, so
the matrix cannot have rank smaller than~$5$. Meanwhile, the computation
of the ideal of the order six minors of $\Phi(P_1, P_2, P_4)$ and its
saturation w.r.t. the condition that the points are distinct \blue{forse si potrebbe dare un nome a questa condizione}, gives that
$P_1, P_2, P_4$ must be aligned and, according to \Cref{proposition:three_aligned_ranks},
that line is tangent to~$\iso$ in one of the three given points.
\end{proof}


\begin{prop}
\label{prop:condition3+1}
Let $P_1, P_2, P_3, P_4$ be four distinct points of the plane such that
$P_1, P_2, P_3$ are aligned and let $r$
be the line joining them. If
$\rk \ \Phi(P_1, P_2, P_3, P_4) \leq 7$ then $r$ is tangent to~$\iso$ in one of the three points $P_1, P_2, P_3$.
\end{prop}
\begin{proof}
Again, we distinguish two cases: $P_1 = (1: 0: 0)$ and
$P_1 = (1: \iii: 0)$. In both cases, the ideal of the order $8$
minors \blue {la comunita' che studia varietà determinantali usa la notazione $I_8(\Phi(P_1, P_2, P_3, P_4))$} of $\Phi(P_1, P_2, P_3, P_4)$ can be computed and saturated
w.r.t.\ the conditions that the points are different and that
$P_1, P_2, P_4$ are not aligned.
The direct inspection of the ideal obtained from these procedures gives the thesis.
\end{proof}

\begin{prop}
\label{proposition:four_aligned}
Let $Q_1, \dotsc, Q_4$ be four distinct aligned points of the plane and
let $r$ be the line through them. Then:
\begin{itemize}
\item $6 \leq \rk  \ \Phi(Q_1, \dotsc, Q_4) \leq 7$;
\item $\rk  \ \Phi(Q_1, \dotsc, Q_4) = 6$ if and only if $r$ is tangent
to~$\iso$.
\end{itemize}
\end{prop}
\begin{proof}
  A direct symbolic computation shows that all the maximal minors of~$\Phi(Q_1, \dotsc, Q_4)$ are
  zero, so $\rk \,(\Phi(Q_1, \dotsc, Q_4)) \leq 7$.
  Indeed, in view of \Cref{lemma:minors}, we can just check the order~$8$ minors of the reduced condition matrix of $Q_1, \dotsc, Q_4$; it turns out that they are all zero.

  On the other hand, the rank of $\Phi(Q_1, \dotsc, Q_4)$ cannot be $5$:
  if this were the case, for any triple~$T$ extracted from the four points, the matrix of conditions would have rank~$5$, hence by \Cref{proposition:three_aligned_ranks} the line~$r$ would be tangent to~$\iso$ in an element of $T$; this is a contradiction.
  So, the first item of the statement is proven.

  We proceed to prove the second item.
  We take the reduced matrix of conditions of~$Q_1, Q_2, Q_3$, to which we add the row~$\phi_1(Q_4)$.
  We call this matrix~$M_1$.
  Similarly, we construct the matrices $M_2$ and~$M_3$.
  We consider the coordinates of the points as variables and we compute
  the ideal $J_1$, the radical of the ideal of the maximal minors of $M_1$ ; similarly, we obtain $J_2$ and~$J_3$.
  The saturation of the sum $J_1 + J_2 + J_3$ by the conditions that the points are distinct is a principal ideal generated by~$\sigma(r)$.
  Since the four points $Q_1, \dotsc, Q_4$ play symmetric roles, the statement is proven.
\end{proof}

In a similar way, it is possible to generalize the above proposition:
\begin{prop}
\label{proposition:n_aligned}
Let $Q_1, \dotsc, Q_r$ be $r\geq 4$ distinct aligned points of the plane and
let $r$ be the line through them. Then:
\begin{itemize}
\item $6 \leq \rk  \ \Phi(Q_1, \dotsc, Q_r) \leq 7$;
\item $\rk  \ \Phi(Q_1, \dotsc, Q_r) = 6$ if and only if $r$ is tangent
to~$\iso$.
\end{itemize}
\end{prop}

We now define three quantities depending on a triple or on a $5$-tuple of points in the plane.

 Let $P$, $Q$ and~$R$ be distinct aligned points in the plane.
 We define the quantity

\delta_1(P_1, P_2, P_4) \cdot \delta_2(P_1, \dots, P_5) = 0.

\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
We denote the coordinate of the points as follows:
$P_1, P_2, P_4 = (A_1: B_1: C_1), (A_2: B_2: C_2), (A_4: B_4: C_4)$,
then $P_3 = u_1P_1+u_2P_2$ and $P_5 = v_1P_1+v_2P_4$. We proceed as in
the proof of \Cref{proposition:three_aligned_ranks}: we find, via symbolic computation, that the determinant of
the reduced matrix of conditions of $P_1, \dotsc, P_5$ is
%
\begin{gather}
\label{delta1delta2}
A_1A_2A_4(u_1A_1+u_2A_2)(v_1A_1+v_2A_4)u_1^2u_2^2v_1^2v_2^2D^5
\delta_1(P_1,P_2,P_4)\delta_2(P_1,\dots,P_5)
\end{gather}
%
where $D$ is the determinant of the matrix whose rows are $P_1, P_2, P_4$
and is non-zero, as well as are non-zero $u_1, u_2, v_1, v_2$ (since we
assume that $P_1, P_2, P_4$ are not aligned and the points are distinct).
As a consequence of \Cref{lemma:minors}, we have that a different
choice of the rows of $M$ would simply modify in the
determinant from \Cref{delta1delta2} the coordinates
$A_1, A_2, \dots, (v_1A_1+v_2A_4)$ to some other coordinates of the points.
Since every point has at least one non-zero coordinate, we have that
$\rk \ \Phi(P_1, \dots, P_5) \leq 9$ if and only if
\[
\delta_1(P_1, P_2, P_4) \cdot \delta_2(P_1, \dots, P_5) = 0 \,. \qedhere

\begin{lemma}
\label{lemma:special_case_rank_8}
Let $P_1, \dots, P_5$ be a $V$-configuration of points and assume that
\[
\scl{P_1}{P_2}=0, \quad \scl{P_2}{P_2}=0, \quad \scl{P_1}{P_4}=0,
\quad \scl{P_4}{P_4}=0.
\]
Then the matrix $\Phi(P_1, \dots, P_5)$ has rank $8$.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
By \Cref{proposition:sigma_tangency},
the lines $P_1+P_2$ and $P_1+P_4$ are tangent to~$\iso$ in~$P_2$ and~$P_4$, respectively. The point $P_1$ cannot be on~$\iso$, hence, using the
action of $\mathrm{SO}_3(\mathbb{C})$, we can assume $P_1 = (1: 0: 0)$.
Since every element of $\mathrm{SO}_3(\mathbb{C})$ fixes~$\iso$ (and sends a tangent line to it into another tangent line to it), when we transform the point~$P_1$
into $(1: 0: 0)$, we transform the points~$P_2$ and~$P_4$ into, respectively,
the points $(0: \iii: 1)$ and $(0: -\iii: 1)$ (which are the common points to
$\iso$ and the tangent lines through~$P_1$).
Therefore, it is enough to study the
specific configuration of the points:
%
\begin{gather*}
P_1 = (1: 0: 0), \quad P_2=(0: \iii: 1), \quad P_3=(u_1, \iii u_2, u_2), \\
P_4 = (0: -\iii: 1), \quad P_5 = (v_1, -\iii v_2, v_2),
\end{gather*}
%
where $(u_1: u_2), (v_1: v_2) \in \p^1$.
In the $15\times 10$ matrix $\Phi(P_1, \dots, P_5)$ we can erase the
rows: $\phi_2(P_1)$ (which is a zero row), the row $\phi_1(P_2)$
(since $\phi_1(P_2)=\iii\phi_2(P_2)$) and, for similar reasons, the
rows: $\phi_1(P_3)$, $\phi_1(P_4)$ and $\phi_1(P_5)$.
Moreover, since the rank of the matrix $\Phi(P_1, P_2, P_3)$ is $5$,
we can also erase the row $\phi_3(P_3)$ and, for the same reason, the
row $\phi_3(P_5)$. The remaining matrix $M$ is a $8\times 10$ matrix.
It is not possible that all the order $8$ minors
of $M$ are zero: the ideal they generate, after saturations ensuring
that the points are distinct, is the whole ring.
\end{proof}

\begin{prop}
\label{proposition:rank_V}
Let $P_1, \dots, P_5$ be a $V$-configuration of
points. Then we have:
\begin{enumerate}
\item $8 \leq \rk \ \Phi(P_1, \dots, P_5) \leq 10$\,;
\item $\rk \ \Phi(P_1, \dots, P_5) \leq 9$ if and only if
$\delta_1(P_1, P_2, P_4) \cdot \delta_2(P_1, \dots, P_5) =0$\,;

If the rank is $\leq 7$, from
\Cref{prop:condition3+1} applied to $P_1, P_2, P_3, P_4$ and $P_1, P_4, P_5, P_2$,
the lines $P_1+P_2$ and $P_1 + P_4$ are tangent to~$\iso$ (the first in $P_2$ or $P_3$ and the second in $P_4$ or $P_5$).
Then we get a contradiction from \Cref{lemma:special_case_rank_8}.
This shows the first item.

The second item follows from \Cref{lemma:d1d2}.

In the rest of the proof, by \Cref{invariance}, we distinguish two possibilities:
$P_1 = (1:\iii :0)$ and
$P_1 = (1: 0: 0)$.
Let $P_2, P_4 = (A_2: B_2: C_2), (A_4: B_4: C_4)$ and
$P_3 = u_1P_1+P_2$, $P_5 = v_1P_1+v_2P_4$ be the other points.
In the first case, we transform the matrix $M = \Phi(P_1, \dots, P_5)$ by elementary row and column operations into $\mathbb{I}_2 \oplus M'$, where $\mathbb{I}_2$ is the order~$2$ identity matrix; thus, $\rk  M \leq 9$ if and only if $\rk  M' \leq 7$.
The computations require several other strategies, but at the end we are
able to see that in this case (i.e.\ the case in which $P_1$ is on~$\iso$), the matrix $M$ cannot have rank less then $9$.
If $P_1 = (1: 0: 0)$, then the ideal of the order $9$ minors of
$\Phi(P_1, \dots, P_5)$ (after several manipulations and saturations)
gives that there a few possibilities which can be summarized by the
following conditions: either the line $P_1+P_2$ is tangent to~$\iso$ (in $P_2$ or $P_3$) and the line $P_1+P_4$ is tangent to~$\iso$ (in $P_4$ or $P_5$) or $\delta_1(P_1, P_2, P_4) = 0$,
\ $\overline{\delta}_1(P_1, P_2, P_3) = 0$,
\ $\overline{\delta}_1(P_1, P_4, P_5) = 0$.
To conclude the proof, we use \Cref{lemma:special_case_rank_8} and \Cref{lemma:d1d2}.

\section{$\delta_2=0$}
\label{sezione_delta_2}

Questa parte va un po' meditata, per cercare una notazione coerente.@@
Forse la definizione \Cref{definition:matrix_conditions} va rimaneggiata.

Given a linear combination $\Lambda = a_0\lambda_0+\cdots+a_9\lambda_9$, we
denote by $v(\Lambda)$ the $10$-component vector given by
$(\lambda_0, \dots, \lambda_9)$. In particular, if $X=(x: y: z)$ and
$f(X) = a_0x^3+a_1x^2y+\cdots+ a_9z^3$ is a degree $3$ homogeneous polynomial
$v(f(X)) = (x^3, x^2y, \dots, z^3)$, while $v(\de_x(f)(X)) = v(\de_x)(f)(X) =%
(3x^2, 2xy, \dots, 0)$. With this notation if $P=(A: B: C)$, we get:
%
\begin{gather*}
\phi_1(P) = A\cdot v(f_x)(P)-B\cdot v(f_y)(P), \\
\phi_2(P) = A\cdot v(f_z)(P)-C\cdot v(f_y)(P),\\
\phi_3(P) = B\cdot v(f_z)(P)-C\cdot v(f_y)(P) 
\end{gather*}
%
Here we want to consider a $V$-configuration of points $P_1, \dots, P_5$
such that $\delta_1(P_1, P_2, P_4) = 0$ or $\delta_2(P_1, \dots, P_5) = 0$.
Moreover, we assume that the rank of the matrix $M$
of the conditions imposed by
the five points (which, by~\Cref{proposition:rank_V}, is at most~$9$)
is indeed $9$, hence there exists precisely one cubic curve $\cbc$ having
$P_1, \dots, P_5$ among its eigenpoints. Another immediate consequence of
the rank $9$ condition is that the
matrix $\Phi(P_1, \dots, P_5)$ has $9$ linearly independent rows, so
we can extract from it a  $9 \times 10$-submatrix
$\mathcal{H}$ whose order $9$ minors are not all zero. If
$\mathcal{H}_i$ is the order $9$ minor of
$\mathcal{H}$ given by erasing the $i$-th column ($i=1, \dots, 10)$, then,
from Cramer's rule, the polynomial defining $\cbc$ is given by
\[
 F(X) = \sum_{i=1}^{10}(-1)^i\det(\mathcal{H}_i)\cdot v(f)(X)_i
\]
(where $v(f)(X)_i$ is the $i$-th monomial of $v(f)(X)$
and $X=(x: y: z)$). In other words,
\[
F(X) = \det \left( \begin{array}{c} \mathcal{H}\\ v(f)(X)
 \end{array} \right)
\]
From the matrix $\mathcal{H}$ it is moreover possible to construct 
the three minors of (\ref{eq:def_matrix}) (i.e.\ the Geiser polynomials
(si chiamano cosi'?@@)), indeed we have:
\begin{prop}
\label{proposition:geiser1}
If $g_1, g_2, g_3$ are the three minors of the matrix 
\[
\left(
\begin{array}{ccc}
x & y & z \\
\de_xF(X) & \de_yF(X) & \de_z F(X)
\end{array}
\right)
\]
they can be computed by:
\[
\det \left( \begin{array}{c} \mathcal{H}\\ 
\phi_1(X)
\end{array} \right),\quad
\det \left( \begin{array}{c} \mathcal{H}\\ 
\phi_2(X)
\end{array} \right), \quad
\det \left( \begin{array}{c} \mathcal{H}\\ 
\phi_3(X)
\end{array} \right)
\]
\end{prop}
\begin{proof} We have:
\begin{eqnarray*}
g_1 & =  & x \cdot \de_y F(X)- y \cdot \de_xF(X) \\
& = & 
x\cdot \de_y \det \left( \begin{array}{c} \mathcal{H}\\ v(f)(X)
\end{array} \right) -y \cdot
\de_x \det \left( \begin{array}{c} \mathcal{H}\\ v(f)(X)
\end{array} \right) \\
& = & \det \left( \begin{array}{c} \mathcal{H}\\ x \cdot v(f_y)(X)-
y \cdot v(f_x)(X)
\end{array} \right)\\
& = & \left( \begin{array}{c} \mathcal{H}\\ 
\phi_1(X)
\end{array} \right)
\end{eqnarray*}
and similarly for $g_2 = x \cdot \de_z F(X)- z \cdot \de_xF(X)$
and $g_3 = y \cdot \de_z F(X)- z \cdot \de_yF(X)$.
\end{proof}


\begin{es} Consider the following five points in a $V$-configuration:
\begin{gather*}
p_1, \ p_2, \ p_4 = (2: -1: 1), \ (-1: 1: 3), \ (3: 6: -1), \\

They satisfy the condition $\delta_2(p_1, \dots, p_5) = 0$.

and can be computed either using their definition,
or~\Cref{proposition:geiser1}.
The common zeros of $g_1, g_2, g_3$ are the points $p_1, \dots, p_5$
and the points $p_6 = (21: 34: -8)$ and $p_7 = (19: 35: -9)$.
\end{es}

\begin{rmk}
In case the matrix $\Phi(P_1, \dots, P_5)$ has rank $8$, the family of
cubics with $P_1, \dots, P_5$ as eigenpoints is one dimensional, so the
above construction can be modified, by substituting one of the rows of
$\mathcal{H}$ with a random row of elements of the field~$K$.
\end{rmk}

Here we want to consider the following problem:
given five generic points in a $V$-configuration and imposing one
fo the two conditions
$\delta_1(P_1, P_2, P_4) = 0$ or $\delta_2(P_1, \dots, P_5) = 0$, assuming
again that the rank of $\Phi(P_1, \dots, P_5)$ is~$9$, what
can we say about all the eigenpoints of the corresponding cubics?


To construct five points $P_1, \dots, P_5$ which are in a $V$-configuration
and such that $\delta_1(P_1, P_2, P_4)= 0$ is quite easy: $P_1$
and $P_2$ can be taken in an arbitrary way, $P_4$ has to be chosen in such
a way that it satisfies the linear
equation $\scl{P_4}{P_2}\scl{P_1}{P_1}-\scl{P_4}{P_1}\scl{P_1}{P_2} = 0$
and $P_3$ and $P_5$ have to be chosen on the lines $P_1+P_2$ and $P_1+P_4$
respectively. In particular, the corresponding variety of cubic curves
has dimension $7$ (parametrized by an opes subset of
$\mathbb{P}^2\times \mathbb{P}^2 \times
\mathbb{P}^1\times  \mathbb{P}^1$).
The construction of a random example
of five points as above, gives a smooth cubic curve whose $7$ eigenpoints
do not have other collinearities (in addition to those of a
$V$-configuration).

The case in which the $V$-configuration satisfies the condition
$\delta_2(P_1, \dots, P_5) = 0$ is somehow different.

We define:
\begin{equation}
  \begin{split}
    U_1 & =  \langle P_1, P_2\rangle \left(\langle P_1, P_1\rangle
  \langle P_4,P_5\rangle - \langle P_1, P_4\rangle \langle P_1, P_5\rangle
  \right)\\
  U_2 & =  \langle P_1, P_2\rangle^2\langle P_4, P_5\rangle
  -\langle P_1, P_4\rangle \langle P_1, P_5\rangle \langle P_2, P_2\rangle
  \label{sst2}
  \end{split}
\end{equation}
in such a way that
$\delta_2(P_1, \dots, P_5) = U_1u_1+U_2u_2$. In order to
have a $V$-configuration satisfying $\delta_2(P_1, \dots, P_5) = 0$ we can
therefore fix $P_1, P_2, P_4$ arbitrarily, $P_5$ any point 
on the line $P_1+P_4$ and in this
way $P_3$ is determined by $u_1 = U_2$ and $u_2 = -U_1$. Note that,
since we assume the points distinct, $U_1$ and $U_2$ cannot be zero.
Also in this case
the subvariety of $\mathbb{P}^9$ given by the cubics with $5$
eigenpoints satisfying $\delta_2 = 0$ is of dimension $7$
(parametrized by an open subset of
$\mathbb{P}^2\times \mathbb{P}^2 \times \mathbb{P}^2\times \mathbb{P}^1$).
Also in this case, it is easy to construct examples, but now it turns out that
the $7$ eigenpoints of the obtained cubics satisfy the further
condition that also $P_6$ and $P_7$ are aligned with $P_1$. To explain
why, we proceed as follows.

Consider again a matrix $\mathcal{H}$ of rank $9$ extracted from
the martix $\Phi(P_1, P_2, P_3, P_4, P_5)$, where now $P_3 = U_2P_1-U_1P_2$
and the three polynomials $g_1, g_2, g_3$ contructed
in~(\ref{proposition:geiser1}). The condition
$\rk \,(\mathcal{H}) = 9$ ensures that
$g_1, g_2$ and $g_3$ cannot be zero and are polynomials of degree
$3$ in $x, y, z$.
The computation shows that three polynomials have a common factor,
hence are of the form $\Omega G_1$, $\Omega G_2$, $\Omega G_3$, where
($\Omega$ is a polynomial in the variables
$A_1, B_1, C_1, A_2, B_2, C_2, A_4, B_4, C_4, v_1, v_2$ but
does not contain the variables $x, y, z$), hence $G_1, G_2, G_3$ are again
degree three polynomials in $x, y, z$, with coefficients in the variables
$A_1, \dots, C_4, v_1, v_2$. The common zeros are the eigenpoints of the
cubic $\cbc$.
%
\begin{rmk} For computational reasons, it is much more convenient
to postpone the substitution $u_1 = U_2$ and $u_2 = -U_1$ after the 
computation of the three polynomials constructed
in~\Cref{proposition:geiser1}.
\end{rmk}
%
\begin{prop}
\label{proposition:G_split}
 The polynomial
$F := C_1G_1-B_1G_2+A_1G_3$ splits into three factors $r_1$, $r_2$, $r_3$,
linear in $x, y, z$.
\end{prop}
\begin{proof}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@ DA QUI...... 

 We know that $G_1, G_2, G_3$ admit the syzygy $z G_1 - y G_2 + x G_3 = 0$.
Then, due to the exactness of the Koszul complex of $(x,y,z)$ 
(see \cite[Chapter~17]{Eisenbud1995}),
we know that $G_1, G_2, G_3$ are the $2 \times 2$ minors of a matrix of the form
%
\[
 \left(
 \begin{array}{ccc}
  x & y & z \\
  H_1 & H_2 & H_3
 \end{array}
 \right)
\]
%
Let $E$ be the zero-set of $G_1, G_2, G_3$.
If $E$ is zero-dimensional and reduced,
then \cite{BGV} proved that in the ideal of~$E$ there exists a unique triple of generators of the form
%
\[
 \left(
 \begin{array}{ccc}
  x & y & z \\
  \partial_x f & \partial_x f & \partial_x f
 \end{array}
 \right)
\]
%
where $f$ is a ternary cubic.
We actually know that $E$ is zero-dimensional, because this can be checked by taking particular values in the $G_i$.
Hence we obtain that the $G_i$ are the $2\times 2$ minors of the previous matrix.

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@ ..... FINO A QUI probabilmente ora e' superfluo
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

Consider the Laguerre map
%
\[
 \gamma \colon \p^2 \setminus E \longrightarrow \p^2 =
 \p \bigl( \left\langle G_1, G_2, G_3 \right\rangle^\vee \bigr) \,.
\]
%
By construction, the map $\gamma$ maps a point~$P$ to the pencil of cubics passing through~$E$ and~$P$.
Whenever we have an aligned triple of eigenpoints and we pick $P \in \p^2$ that is aligned with them, then the pencil of cubics is given by the line together with the pencil of conics passing through the remaining four eigenpoints.
This means that if we have an aligned triple of eigenpoints, then any point on such a line is mapped by $\gamma$ to the same element.
Hence $\gamma$ contracts the line passing through the three aligned eigenpoints.
Another description of~$\gamma$ is given by $P \mapsto (G_1(P): G_2(P): G_3(P))$.
This can hence be written as $P \mapsto P \wedge \nabla(f)(P)$.
The image of~$P$ is then the intersection point of the two lines:
%
\[
 \left\{
 \begin{array}{l}
  A x + B y + Cz  = 0\\
  \partial_x f(P) + \partial_y f (P) + \partial_z f(P) = 0
 \end{array}
 \right.
\]
%
Since we know that there is a whole line that is contracted to the same point~$Q$,
we know that the first equation is a factor of the second.
Therefore we have $\left\langle Q, (x,y,z) \right\rangle = 0$, so $\left\langle Q, \nabla f (x,y,z) \right\rangle = 0$.
It then follows that $\left\langle P, (x, y, z) \wedge \nabla f(x,y,z) \right\rangle = 0$, which implies that $A G_1 + B G_2 + C G_3$
\\
@@@@
QUI C'E' un meno da qualche parte? \\
@@@\\
evaluates to zero for each $(x,y,z)$ such that $\left\langle Q, (x,y,z) \right\rangle= 0$, namely for each point in the line $P_1 P_2$.
This means that the line $P_1 P_2$ is contained in $E$.
By repeating this argument in the case $P_1 P_4$ we see that $E$ splits into three distinct lines.
\end{proof}

According to \Cref{proposition:G_split}, the polynomial
$C_1G_1-B_1G_2+A_1G_3$ splits into three factors $r_1$, $r_2$, $r_3$,
linear in $x, y, z$, which
correspond to the line $P_1+P_2$, the line $P_1+P_4$ and the line $P_6+P_7$.
The factorization of $F$ gives that the factor $r_3$ is:
\[
r_3 = 2yv_1A_1B_1^4A_2^2B_2A_4^3-2xv_1B_1^5A_2^2B_2A_4^3+\cdots
-2 yv_1A_1B_1^4A_2^2B_2A_4^3
\]
and is composed by almost $2000$ monomials. The relevant fact is that when we
evaluate $r_3$ on the coordinates of $P_1$, we get zero. Hence we have:
\begin{prop}
\label{proposition:terzo_allineamento}
If we have a $V$-configuration of five points $P_1, \dots, P_5$ 
such that the rank of the matrix $\Phi(P_1, \dots, P_5)$ is $9$ and
such that $\delta_2(P_1, \dots, P_5) = 0$,
then the unique cubic determined by the condition that $P_1, \dots, P_5$
are eigenpoints, has also the two other eigenpoints $P_6$ and $P_7$
aligned with $P_1$.
\end{prop}

forse qui va la parte sulle cubiche singolari?

Finally, we want to see when, in a $V$-configuration, we have that the point
$P_1$ is singular.

\begin{prop}
\label{proposition:P1_sing}
If $P_1, \dots, P_5$ is a $V$ configuration and if $C$ is a cubic which
has among the eigenpoints $P_1, \dots, P_5$, then $P_1$ is singular if
and only if one of the following conditions is satisfied:
\begin{enumerate}
\item $\delta_1(P_1, P_2, P_4) = 0$ and $\overline{\delta}_1(P_1, P_2, P_3) = 0$;
\item $\delta_1(P_1, P_2, P_4) = 0$ and $\overline{\delta}_1(P_1, P_4, P_5) = 0$;
\item $\overline{\delta}_1(P_1, P_2, P_3) = 0$ and
$\overline{\delta}_1(P_1, P_4, P_5) = 0$.
\end{enumerate}
\end{prop}
\begin{proof}
\verb+file: cubicaSingolare1ii0.sage+ e \verb+cubicaSingolare100.sage+\\
As usual, we can split the problem into two cases: $P_1 = (1: \iii: 0)$
and $P_1 = (1: 0: 0)$. In both cases we construct the matrix
$\Phi(P_1, \dots, P_5)$ (for $P_2$, $P_4$ generic, $P_3$ aligned with
$P_1$ and $P_2$ and $P_5$ aligned with $P_1$ and $P_4$). To this matrix we add
a row which correspond to the condition that $P_1$ is singular, obtaining
in this way a matrix $M$. After
suitable manipulations of the matrix $M$, we see that the condition that
the linear system associated to $M$ (which gives the coefficient of the cubic
having $P_1, \dots, P_5$ eigenpoints and $P_1$ singular) gives no solution
for the case $P_1=(1: \iii: 0)$ and the three above conditions for the
case in which $P = (1: 0: 0)$.

In this Section we study the possible configurations of
eigenpoints for cubics with a $V$-configuration
satisfying the condition $\rk \Phi(P_1, \dots, P_5) = 8$. According
to~\Cref{proposition:rank_V}, we have to distinguish the two cases
\begin{eqnarray}
\delta_1(P_1, P_2, P_4)=\overline{\delta}_1(P_1, P_2, P_3) =
\overline{\delta}_1(P_1, P_4, P_5) = 0,
\label{rk8_1}\\
\sigma(P_1, P_2) = 0 \mbox{ and } \sigma(P_1, P_4) = 0
\label{rk8_2}
\end{eqnarray}
(hence condition~(\ref{rk8_2}) means that \emph{the two lines of
the $V$-configuration are tangent to $\iso$ in $P_2$ and $P_4$}).


Let us start with the first case.

The three conditions~(\ref{rk8_1}) give (using (\ref{rmk_delta_1})
and (\ref{rmk_delta_2})) give that we can chose the points as follows:
\begin{itemize}
\item $P_1$ and $P_2$ in an arbitrary way;
\item $P_4$ in the $\mathbb{P}^1$
space of points orthogonal to $s_{11}P_2-s_{12}P_1$;
\item $P_3 = (s_{12}^2+s_{11}s_{12})P_1-2s_{11}s_{12}P_2$;
\item $P_5 = (s_{12}^2+s_{11}s_{12})P_1-2s_{11}s_{14}P_4$.
\end{itemize}

Such a choice
of points gives the matrix $M = \Phi(P_1, \dots, P_5)$ of rank $8$ and
therefore the linear system associated to $M$, which gives the
coefficients of the cubics with eigenpoints $P_1, \dots, P_5$, has $\infty^1$
solutions. This shows that the variety $\mathcal{V}$ of these cubics is
of dimension $6$ and is parametrized by an open subset of 
$\mathbb{P}^2 \times \mathbb{P}^2\times \mathbb{P}^1\times \mathbb{P}^1$.
Moreover, from~\Cref{proposition:P1_sing}, we have that all these cubics
are singular in $P_1$.
If we take a random point of this variety, we see that the corresponding
cubic has $7$ distinct eigenpoints, is singular in $P_1$ and the $7$ points
do not satisfy other collinearities in addition to those of $P_1, P_2, P_3$
and $P_1, P_4, P_5$.

\begin{rmk} If $P_1, \dots, P_5$ satisfy the conditions~(\ref{rk8_1}),
it follows that also $\delta_2(P_1, \dots, P_5) = 0$. Since, 
in general, we do not have the collinearity $P_1, P_6, P_7$,
we see that the hypothesis ``rank $9$''
in~\Cref{proposition:terzo_allineamento} is necessary.
\end{rmk}

Concerning possible sub-cases with further collinearities of the points,
the following results hold:

\begin{prop}
\label{three_d_three_alignments}
If the five points $P_1, \dots, P_5$ satisfy~(\ref{rk8_1}),
then, among the $\infty^1$ cubic curves that we get from the
solution of the linear system whose coefficients matrix is $M$, there is 
a cubic curve with $7$ eigenpoints with the following three alignments:
$(P_1, P_2, P_3)$, $(P_1, P_4, P_5)$, $(P_1, P_6, P_7)$. \\
No choices of $P_1, \dots, P_5$ allow to obtain further alignments of the
$7$ eigenpoints.
\end{prop}
And, moreover,
\begin{prop}
\label{prop:d2_6allin}
If the five points $P_1, \dots, P_5$ satisfy~(\ref{rk8_1})
and if we impose the condition that there is an eigenpoint, say $P_6$, 
which is aligned with $P_2$ and $P_4$ then the eigenpoints satisfy all these
alignments:
\[
(P_1, P_2, P_3), (P_1, P_4, P_5), (P_2, P_4, P_6), (P_2, P_5, P_7),
(P_3, P_4, P_7), (P_3, P_5, P_6)
\]
Hence the points $P_6$ and $P_7$ are such that
$P_6 = (P_2+P_4) \cap (P_3+P_5)$
and $P_7 = (P_3+P_4) \cap (P_2+P_5)$.
(Of course, a similar result holds if we take $P_3$ in place of $P_2$ or $P_5$
in place of $P_4$).
\end{prop}
The two above propositions exhaust all the possible configurations
of collinearities of the eigenpoints in case of condition~(\ref{rk8_1}).

The proof we give to the two propositions above is computational.
Using the action of $\mathrm{SO}_3(\mathbb{C})$ (see~\Cref{two_orbits}),
we can assume $P_1= (1: \iii: 0)$ or $P_1= (1: 0: 0)$. As observed
in the proof of~\Cref{proposition:rank_V}, if $P_1 = (1: \iii: 0)$,\\
(@@ \verb+Vedi file rank_8_2_1_ii_0.sage+), \\
the martix
$\Phi(P_1, \dots, P_5)$ cannot have rank smaller then $9$, so the only
case to consider is given by $P_1 = (1: 0: 0)$. Hence
$P_2 = (A_2: B_2: C_2)$, $P_4 = (A_4: B_4: C_4)$ and
$P_3 = u_1P_1+u_2P_2$, $P_5=v_1P_1+v_2P_4$.
The condition $\delta_1(P_1, P_2, P_4)=0$ reduces to $B_2B_4+C_2C_4$
and it is easy to contruct the explicit coordinates of the involved points.

The problem of considering all the possible further
collinearities of the points can be converted into the study of suitable
ideals in the coordinates of the points and can be attacked with
computational tools. More precisely,
consider the matrix $\Phi(P_1, \dots, P_5)$ and select $8$ linearly independent
rows (since $P_1$ is numeric, it can be seen that for instance the rows
of position $0, 1, 3, 5, 6, 8, 10, 12$ are a good choice and avoid to consider
many exceptions) and let $M_1$ be a matrix obtained in this way.
We fix two numeric $10$-dimensional vectors $V_a$ and $V_b$ and we construct
$M_a$ (resp.\ $M_b$) obtained by vertically stacking $V_a$ (resp.\ $V_b$)
vector to $M_1$. The rank of $M_a$ and $M_b$ is $9$ (unless an unlucky choice
of the vecors, in which case they can be changed). The matrices $M_a$ and
$M_b$ play the same role of the matrix $\mathcal{H}$
of~\Cref{sezione_delta_2}, hence we can do the same construction explained
there, in order to obtain the line $r_a$ passing through the two
eigenpoints $P_6$ and $P_7$ of the cubic obtained from $M_a$ and the
line $r_b$ passing through the analogous eigenpoints of the cubic
obtained from $M_b$.
Hence the line $r = w_ar_a+w_br_b$
(where $w_a, w_b$ are parameters) is the line passing through the eigenpoints
$P_6$ and $P_7$
of the generic cubic of the $\infty^1$ family, i.e.\ the cubic obtained
the three collinearities $(P_1, P_2, P_3)$,
$(P_1, P_4, P_5)$ and $(P_1, P_6, P_7)$.

Among all the possible cubics of the $5$ dimensional variety we get from
condition~(\ref{rk8_2}) there are some subfamilies in which the eigenpoints
have other alignments. More precisely,
\begin{prop}
\label{prop:rk8_2B}
In the family of all cubics which satisfy condition~(\ref{rk8_2}) there 
are cubics which have $7$ eigenpoints with the alignments:
\[
(P_1, P_2, P_3),\  (P_1, P_4, P_5),\  (P_1, P_6, P_7),\  (P_2, P_4, P_6)
\]
and cubics which have $7$ eigenponts with the alignments:
\[
(P_1, P_2, P_3),\  (P_1, P_4, P_5), \ (P_1, P_6, P_7),\  (P_2, P_5, P_6),\ 
(P_3, P_4, P_6),\  (P_3, P_5, P_7)
\]
No other collinearities among the eigenpoints are possible.
\end{prop}


In order to get the proof of~\Cref{prop:rk8_2B}
we consider again the action of $\SO_3(\C)$ and here we can assume:
\[
P_1 = (1: 0: 0), \quad P_2 = (0: \iii: 1), \quad P_4 = (0: -\iii: 1)
\]
(and $P_3 = u_1P_1+u_2P_2$, $P_5 = v_1P_1+v_2P_4$). In this situation it
is easy to see that the solution of the system $\Phi(P_1, \dots, P_5)$
gives the following family of cubic curves:
\[
\mathcal{C}(l_1, l_2) = l_1\mathcal{C}_1+l_2\mathcal{C}_2
\]
where
\begin{eqnarray}
  \mathcal{C}_1 & = & x \cdot \left(2x^{2} + 3 y^{2} + 3 z^{2}\right)\\
  \mathcal{C}_2 & = & (y + \iii z) \cdot (y - \iii z)
\cdot (y u_{2} v_{1} - \iii z u_{2} v_{1} - y u_{1} v_{2} - 
\iii z u_{1} v_{2} + 2 \iii x u_{2} v_{2})  \nonumber
\label{famigliaCubDim1}
\end{eqnarray}
Then, from these equations, all the computations which allow to prove
the two above propositions are easy.

We can describe in an explicit way the eigenpoints points
of~\Cref{prop:rk8_2B} as follows:
\begin{itemize}
\item $P_1$ can be chosen in an arbitrary way (out of $\iso$);
\item $P_2$ and $P_4$ are the two points in which the
tangents from $P_1$ to $\iso$ meet $\iso$;
\item $P_3$ and $P_5$ can be chosen in an arbitrary way on the lines
$P_1+P_2$ and $P_1+P_4$ respectively;
\item $P_6 = s_{11}s_{15}P_3-2s_{13}s_{15}P_1 + s_{11}s_{13}P_5$;
\item $P_7 = s_{11}s_{15}P_3+s_{13}s_{15}P_1 + s_{11}s_{13}P_5$.

\section{Eigenpoints of positive dimension}


\begin{lemma}
\label{4ptiSuRetta2}
Suppose $P_1, P_2, P_3, P_4$ are four distinct points belonging to a line $t$
and let
$C$ be a cubic such that has $P_1, \dots, P_4$ among its eigenponts. Then
all the points of $t$ are eigenpoints of~$C$. Moreover,
\begin{equation*}
6 \leq \rk  \  \Phi(P_1, P_2, P_3, P_4) \leq 7
\end{equation*}
and the rank is $6$ if and only if $\sigma(P_1, P_2) = 0$, i.e.\ if
and only if $t$ is tangent to the isotropic conic. If the rank of
the above matrix is $7$, then all the cubics which have the line $t$
of eigenpoints are given by $t^2l$ where $l$ is any line of the plane. 
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
\verb+file: fourCollinearPoints.sage+\\
It is not restrictive to assume that one of the points (say $P_1$) is
the point $(1: 0: 0)$. 
With this simplification, the computation of the order $6$ and order $7$
minors of $\phi(P_1, \dots, P_4)$ is not hard and 
the first part of the thesis follows. If the rank of $\Phi(P_1, \dots, P_4)$
is $7$, then the cubics which have $P_1, \dots, P_4$ as eigenpoints
give a two dimensional linear subspace $W$ of $\mathbb{P}^9$, but also all
the cubics defined by $t^2l$ have $P_1, \dots, P_4$ as eigenponts and are
a linear space of $\mathbb{P}^9$ contained in $W$. Hence the two linear
spaces coincide.
\end{proof}

\begin{prop}
\label{cubiche_con_2_rette}
Let $C$ be a cubic which has, among its eigenpoints, two lines $t_1$ 
and $t_2$. Then $t_1$ and $t_2$ are tangent to the isotropic conic
in two points $Q_1$ and $Q_2$ and, if $r$ is the line $Q_1+Q_2$
of equation $ax+by+cz=0$, the polynomial defining $C$ is:
\begin{equation}
C(r) = \left(r^2-3\left(a^2+b^2+c^2\right)\iso\right)r.
\label{2_lines_of_eigenpoints}
\end{equation}
$C$ has, in addition to $t_1$ and $t_2$, also the eigenpoint $(a: b: c)$
(the pole of $r$ w.r.t.\ $\iso$). \\
Conversely, if $C$ is defined by~(\ref{2_lines_of_eigenpoints}), where
$r$ is any line $ax+by+cz$ ($a, b, c \in K$), then
the eigenpoints of $C$ are the lines $t_1$ and $t_2$ (tangent to $C$
in the points $Q_1$ and $Q_2$ of intersection of $r$ with $\iso$) and
the point $(a: b: c)$.
\end{prop}
\begin{proof}
\verb+file: due_rette_autopunti.sage+\\
Let $t_1$ be a line of eigenpoints of $C$. If $t_1$ is not tangent 
to $\iso$, from~\Cref{4ptiSuRetta2} $C$ is given by $t_1^2l$ (for
a suitable line $l$), but this cubic cannot have the line $t_2$
of eigenpoints.
In this way we see that $t_1$ and $t_2$ must be tangent to $\iso$ (in
$Q_1$ and $Q_2$ respectively). Let $Q_3 = t_1 \cap t_2$. We can assume
that $Q_3 = (1: 0: 0)$, hence $t_1$, $t_2$ and $r$ have equations,
respectively, $x+\iii y=0$, $x-\iii y = 0$ and  $x=0$.
If we impose to the generic cubic of the plane to have 
$t_1$ and $t_2$ of eigenpoints, we get only one cubic defined by
$x(2x^2 + 3y^2 + 3z^2)$, which is of the
form~(\ref{2_lines_of_eigenpoints}). If, conversely, we fix a line
of the plane of equation $ax+by+cz=0$ and we consider the cubic $C$ of
equation given by~(\ref{2_lines_of_eigenpoints}), the ideal of
the eigenpoints of $C$ decomposes into an ideal whose radical is
the ideal of the point $(a:, b: c)$ and another ideal generated by
a degree two polynomial which give a singular conic of the pencil
of conics bitangent to $\iso$ in the two points $\iso \cap r$, hence
this conic splits into the two tangent lines to $\iso$ in $\iso \cap r$.
\end{proof}

\begin{prop}
Given a line $t$ of the plane, if $t$ is not tangent to the isotropic 
conic, then all the cubics which have, among their 
eigenpoints, the points of $t$ are defined by the polynomial $r^2l$,
where $l$ is any line of the plane. If $t$ is tangent to $\iso$, then
all the cubics which have among their eigenpoints the points of $t$ are
defined by the polynomials
\begin{equation}
\label{cubiche_con_retta_autop_tg}
t^2l+\lambda C(r),
\end{equation}
where $\lambda \in K$ and $r$ is a line
passing through the tangent point $\iso\cap t$ (and $C(r)$ is defined
in~(\ref{2_lines_of_eigenpoints})). Conversely, if $r$ is a line and
$t$ is another line, tangent $\iso$ in one of the two points of intersections
of $r$ with $\iso$, then all the cubics given
by~(\ref{cubiche_con_retta_autop_tg}) have, among their eigenpoints,
the line $t$.
\end{prop}
\begin{proof}
\verb+una_retta_tg_autop.sage+\\
The first part of the proposition is contained in~\Cref{4ptiSuRetta2}.
Suppose $t$ is tangent to $\iso$. We asume that $t$ is the line
$x+\iii y$, hence tangent to $\iso$ in $P = (1: \iii: 0)$.
We impose to the points
of $t$ to be eigenpoints of a generic cubic $a_0x^3+a_1x^2y+\cdots+a_9z^3$
and we get a linear system in $a_0, \dots, a_9$ whose solution gives that
the cubics can be expressed as a linear combinations of the following
four cubics:
\[
H_1 = t^2x, \quad H_2 = t^2y, \quad H_3 = t^2z, \quad H_4 = C(r)
\]
where $r$ is a line passing through $P$ (if, for instance, $r$
is $z$, then $H_4 = z(x^2 + y^2 + 2/3z^2)$. Hence the cubics are of the
form~(\ref{cubiche_con_retta_autop_tg}). Conversely, it is easy to verify
that all the cubics $C(r)$ of~(\ref{cubiche_con_retta_autop_tg}) are
linear combinations of $H_1, \dots, H_4$, hence it is enough
to see that every linear combination of $H_1, \dots, H_4$ gives a
cubic which has the line $t$ among its eigenpints, and the this result
follows from an explicit computation.
\end{proof}

\begin{prop}
Let $t$ be a line tangent to the isotropic conic in a point $P$. Then all the
cubics of the family~(\ref{cubiche_con_retta_autop_tg}) are singular in
$P$ and $t$ is one of the two tangents to the cubic in $P$. 
\end{prop}
\begin{proof}
As seen in the previous proposition, up to the action of $\SO$, all the 
cubics are a linear combination of $H_1, \dots, H_4$ and a direct
computation gives the thesis.

\begin{lemma}
\label{lemma:fourOnIso}
Suppose $P_1, P_2, P_3, P_4$ are four distinct points on $\iso$ and let 
$C$ be a cubic such that has $P_1, \dots, P_4$ among its eigenpoints.
Then all the points of $\iso$ are eigenpoints and $C$ splits into $\iso$
and a line $r$. In particular, if four
distinct points of $\iso$ are eigenpoints of a cubic, then all the
points of $\iso$ are eigenpoints of the cubic. 
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
\verb+file eigenpointsConic.sage+\\
As usual, we can assume that $P_1 = (1: \iii: 0)$. Hence all the other points
of $\iso$ are given by
$P(w) = (\iii(w^2 + 1): 1 - w^2: -2w)$ ($w\in K$), so we can assume
$P_2 = P(w_1)$, $P_3 = P(w_2)$ and $P_4 = P(w_3)$, where $w_i$'s are
all distinct. The cubics which have $P_1, \dots, P_4$ among the eigenpoints
are obtained from the linear system whose associated matrix is
$M = \Phi(P_1, P_2, P_3, P_4)$. The rank of $M$ is $7$. In order to see this,
we can, firt of all, select a submatrix of $M$ obtained erasing a
row for each of the points $P_i$ (since we know that the three vectors
$\phi(P)$ are linearly dependent for every $P$). In the obtained matrix
all the order $8$ minors are easy to compute and are zero.
If all the order~$7$
minors are set to zero, we get an ideal that, after suitable saturations,
is $(1)$. Since the rank of $M$ is~$7$, all the cubics for which the 
four points are eigenponits are a linear variety $\mathcal{L}$
in $\mathbb{P}^9$
of dimension $2$, but all the cubics which split into $\iso$ and a line
of the plane do have all the points of $\iso$ among the eigenpoints and
these cubics give a linear variety of dimension $2$ in $\mathbb{P}^9$
which therefore coincides with $\mathcal{L}$. 
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}
\label{lemma3ptiSuCiso}
It is not possible to have a cubic $C$ which has, among its eigenpoints,
an irreducible conic $\Gamma$ tangent in a point $P_1$ to the isotropic
conic and intersecting $\iso$ in two other distinct points.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
\verb+caso3ptiIso_2.sage+\\
As in the proof~\Cref{lemma:fourOnIso}, we can assume that
$P_1 = (1: \iii: 0)$
and $P_2$ and $P_3$ are $P(w_1)$ and $P(w_2)$. Then we construct
the pencil of conics passing through $P_1$, $P_2$ and $P_3$ and
tangent to Ciso in $P_1$ and we construct two distinct points
$Q_1$ and $Q_2$ on a conic of this family. If there is a conic $\Gamma$
tangent to $\iso$ in $P_1$ and passing through $P_2$ and $P_3$,
then, for suitable values of the parameters defining the points
$P_1, P_2, P_3$ and $Q_1$ and $Q_2$, the matrix
$M = \Phi(P_1, P_2, P_3, Q_1, Q_2)$
must have rank $9$ or smaller. Again, erasing some rows of $M$
which are linear dependent from the others and observing that,
with row elementary operations we can erase some columns of $M$,
we can see that $M$ cannot have rank $8$ or smaller and if $M$
has rank $9$, then the corresponding cubic does not have a conic
among its eigenpoints.
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}
\label{lemma:bitangentToCiso}
If a cubic $C$ has, among its eigenpoints, an irreducible conic $\Gamma$
which is tangent to $\iso$ in two distinct points $P_1$ and $P_2$, then
the equation of $C$ is of the form $(\lambda \iso + \mu r^2)r$ where
$r$ is the equation of the line $P_1+P_2$ and $\lambda, \mu$ are parameters
in $K$.

The proof is quite similar to the proof of~\Cref{lemma3ptiSuCiso}. Also
here we can assume that $P_1 = (1: \iii: 0)$ and we construct the pencil of
bitangent conics in $P_1$ and $P_2$ to $\iso$. Then we construct three
points $Q_1, Q_2$ and $Q_3$ on a concic of the pencil
and we study the matrix $M = \Phi(P_1, P_2, Q_1, Q_2, Q_3)$. We can see
that the rank of this matrix is $9$ (for each admissible value of the
involved parameters), hence $M$ identifies a cubic~$C$. The computation
of $C$ shows that its equation is of the above form.

$\lambda \iso+3\mu r^2$ (bitangent to $\iso$ in the points $\iso \cap r$)

$C$ is a cubic of the plane which has a conic among its eigenpoints,

If the equation of $C$ is of the form descibed above, a direct computation
shows that the eigenpoints of $C$ are the pole of $r$ with respect to $\iso$
and the conic $\lambda \iso+3\mu r^2$. Suppose, conversely, that $C$ has
a conic among its eigenpoints. First, we assume that the conic $\Gamma$
is irreducible. If $\Gamma$ is the isotropic conic,
then~\Cref{lemma:fourOnIso} gives that $C$ splits into $\iso$ and a line.
If $\Gamma$ does not coincide with the
isotropic conic, as a consequence
of~\Cref{lemma:fourOnIso} and~\Cref{lemma3ptiSuCiso} must be bitangent,
in two points $P_1$ and $P_2$, to $\iso$. Then we get the thesis
from~\Cref{lemma:bitangentToCiso}. If $\Gamma$ is reducible, 
from~\Cref{cubiche_con_2_rette}  we have that $\Gamma$ splits

\section{The locus of cubic ternary forms with an aligned triple of eigenpoints}
\label{locus_one_alignment}

\begin{definition}
 We set $\mathcal{L} \subseteq \p^9$ to be the closure of the locus of classes of cubic forms $f$ having a reduced zero-dimensional eigenscheme $E(f)$ with an aligned eigentriple.
\end{definition}

\begin{theorem}
The variety~$\mathcal{L}$ is an irreducible hypersurface.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
By the Gallet - Logar construction, for a a general fixed aligned triple of points, the set of cubic forms having such a triple as eigenpoints is a linear system of dimension 3. Since the variety of aligned triples is $5$-dimensional, this proves that $\mathcal{L}$ is a hypersurface.

For the irreducibility, we maybe need the argument on the Geiser map. Is there a simpler one?
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}
\label{lemma:pencil_one_aligned}
 If $f$ and $g$ are general cubics, then any cubic in the pencil $\lambda f + \mu g$ for $(\lambda: \mu) \in \p^1$ has at most one aligned triple of eigenpoints.
\end{lemma}

This is a corollary of the following result.

\begin{prop}
    The locus of cubics that have at least two aligned triples of eigenpoints has codimension~$2$ in~$\p^9$.
\end{prop}
\begin{proof}
    Conti di Sandro.
\end{proof}

\begin{definition}
 We define $\Delta \subset \mathcal{L}$ to be the closure of the locus of cubics with at least two aligned triples of eigenpoints.
\end{definition}

\begin{prop}
  The variety~$\Delta$ has dimension~$7$ and it is the union of two irreducible components~$\Delta_1$ and~$\Delta_2$.
\end{prop}

In what follows, we shall use the following notation.
Denote by $M_1$, $M_2$ and $M_3$ the three minors of \Cref{eq:def_matrix} relative to a cubic form $f$.
The net of cubics, which base locus is the eigenscheme $E(f)$, will be denoted by $\Lambda_f = \langle M_1, M_2, M_3 \rangle$.
\begin{lemma}
\label{lemma:scroll}
 If $f$ and $g$ are general cubics, then
 %
 \[
   \mathcal{N} := \bigcup_{(\lambda : \mu) \in \p^1} \Lambda_{\lambda f + \mu g} \subset \p^9
 \]
 %
 is an embedding of a rational projective bundle and has degree~$3$.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
Consider the projective bundle given by the family of planes
%
\[
{\mathcal P} := \{ \Lambda_{\lambda f + \mu g} \, : \, (\lambda: \mu)\in \p^1 \} \subset \p^1 \times \p^9
\]
%
Then $\mathcal{N}$ is the projection of~$\mathcal{P}$ on the second factor.
However, the map ${\mathcal P} \to {\mathcal N}$ contracts no subvariety of any plane of ${\mathcal P}$, so either it is an embedding or it contracts some horizontal curve. In the latter case, all the planes of the family should intersect in at least one point. In particular, the two nets $\Lambda_f$ and $\Lambda_g$ should have non-empty intersection.
If we denote by $M_1$, $M_2$ and $M_3$ the $2 \times 2$ minors relative to~$f$, and by $N_1$, $N_2$ and $N_3$ the ones relative to~$g$, the vectorial dimension of the linear span $\left\langle M_1, M_2, M_3, N_1, N_2, N_3 \right\rangle$ should be strictly less than $6$. This can be avoided, since such a condition corresponds to a proper closed subscheme of $\p^9 \times \p^9$.

It follows that if $f$ and $g$ are general enough, then $\mathcal{N}$ is a $3$-dimensional rational normal scroll in $\p(\left\langle M_1, M_2, M_3, N_1, N_2, N_3 \right\rangle) \cong \p^5$.
Being a variety of minimal degree, its degree is $5+1-3 = 3$.
\end{proof}

\begin{theorem}
The degree of $\mathcal L$ is equal to
\[
  \deg \ \mathcal L =  15.
\]
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
We start by observing that a reduced $0$-dimensional eigenscheme contains an aligned triple if and only if the net of cubics $\Lambda_f = \langle M_1, M_2, M_3 \rangle$ contains a cubic which splits in three lines, a so called \emph{triangle}. Moreover, if $f$ is general enough, we have exactly one aligned triple and the other $4$ points are in general position; in this case, the net $\Lambda_f$ contains exactly three triangles, namely the unions of the line passing through the aligned triple and the reducible conics through the $4$ points in general position.

To determine the degree of $\mathcal L$ we consider a general pencil of cubic forms $\lambda f + \mu g$, and we will compute the number of elements with associated net $\Lambda_{\lambda f + \mu g}$ containing a triangle.

To this aim, denote by ${\mathcal T} \subset \p^9$ the variety of triangles; it is a classical result that its dimension is $6$ and its degree is $15$,
see for instance \cite[Section 2.2.2]{3264}. We now consider the variety~${\mathcal N}$ from \Cref{lemma:scroll}.
\comment{
given by the union of the nets of cubics of the pencil
$$
{\mathcal N} = \bigcup_{(\lambda : \mu) \in \p^1} \Lambda_{\lambda f + \mu g} \subset \p^9.
$$
Observe that we can assume that ${\mathcal N}$ is an embedding of a rational projective bundle; indeed, it can be seen as an immersion of the $\p^2$-bundle over $\p^1$ given by the family the planes ${\mathcal P}=
\{\Lambda_{\lambda f + \mu g}\ : \ (\lambda:\mu)\in \p^1\} \subset \p^1 \times \p^9$. The map ${\mathcal P} \to {\mathcal N}$ contracts no subvariety of any plane of ${\mathcal P}$, so it is either an embedding or it contracts some horizontal curve. In the latter case, all the planes of the family should intersect in at least one point. In particular, the two nets $\Lambda_f$ and $\Lambda_g$ should have non-empty intersection.
If we denote by $M_1$, $M_2$ and $M_3$ the $2 \times 2$ minors relative to $f$, and by $N_1$, $N_2$ and $N_3$ the ones relative to $g$, the vectorial dimension of the linear span
$\langle M_1,M_2,M_3,N_1,N_2,N_3
\rangle$ should be strictly less than $6$. This can be avoided, since such a condition corresponds to a proper closed subscheme of $\p^9 \times \p^9$.

It follows that if ${\mathcal N}$ is general enough, it is a $3$-dimensional rational normal scroll in $\p(\langle M_1,M_2,M_3,N_1,N_2,N_3
\rangle) \cong \p^5$, and being a variety of minimal degree, its degree is $\deg {\mathcal N}=5+1-3=3$.
}
Note that, since each net containing a triangle, actually contains exactly $3$ of them, the number of nets of ${\mathcal N}$ containing some triangle is given by
%
\[
\frac {{\mathcal T} \cdot {\mathcal N}}{3} =\frac{{15} \cdot {3}}{3}=15 \,.
\]
%
This hence implies that $\deg {\mathcal L} = 15$.
\end{proof}

The following pencil of cubic forms admits exactly $15$ cubics with an aligned triple of eigenpoints ..

In table~\ref{table:all_alignments} are listed all the possible configuration
of 7 distinct points of the plane, according to their collinearities. Here
we want to see which of those nine configurations can be realized by
the seven eigenpoints of a cubic and, in case the configuration is
realizable, which are the cubics with that configuration of eigenpoints.

First of all, it is well-known that configuration (9) cannot be realized
by seven points of the plane over a field of zero
characteristic (see \cite{Whitney1935}), therefore we will not consider
it in our analysis.

\underline{Configuration (1)} can be realized,
\Cref{proposition:three_aligned_ranks} and Section~\ref{locus_one_alignment}
give a description of the cubics with such a configuration of points.

\underline{Configuration (2)} means that the points $P_1, \dots, P_5$ are in a
$V$-configuration, hence the rank of the matrix $\Phi(P_1, \dots, P_5)$
must be $9$ or $8$. If the rank is $9$, then $\delta_1(P_1, P_2, P_4) = 0$
or $\delta_2(P_1, \dots, P_5) = 0$, see~\Cref{proposition:rank_V}.
From \Cref{proposition:terzo_allineamento} we have that the only possibility
is $\delta_1(P_1, P_2, P_4) = 0$. Hence if we fix two points $P_1$ and $P_2$
in the plane and we choose $P_4$ such that $\delta_1(P_1, P_2, P_4) = 0$
(@@ si puo' mettere migliore condizione) and then if we chose $P_3$
on the line $P_1+P_2$ and $P_5$ on the line $P_1+P_4$, we have a cubic
with a configuration of type (2). In case of rank $8$, as seen,
configuration (2) can be
obtained from the conditions~(\ref{rk8_1}) (and hence are sub-cases
of the case $\delta_1(P_1, P_2, P_4)=0$). Configuration (2) can also be
obtained from~(\ref{rk8_2}) in the general case. @@ e' un caso delta1 = 0?

Here we assume therefore that we have among the $7$ points of (3),

\begin{lemma}
\label{no_delta1_delta1} Suppose we have  seven eigenpoints $P_1, \dots, P_7$
of a cubic in configuration (3). Then among the $7$ points there is a
$V$-configuration that satisfies a $delta_2$ condition.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
%% la dim si trova in config3.sage
The points $P_1, P_2, P_3, P_4, P_5$ are in a $V$-configuration. As said, 
we assume the matrix $\Phi(P_1, \dots, P_5)$ has
rank $9$. If
$\delta_2(P_1, \dots, P_5) = 0$, we have the thesis, otherwise,
$\delta_1(P_1, P_2, P_4) = 0$. Then consider the $V$-configuration
$P_1, P_2, P_3, P_6, P_7$. As above, we suppose $\delta_1(P_1, P_2, P_6) = 0$.
The two $\delta_1$-equations give two linear equations in the coordinates
of $P_2$. Assuming the matrix of the system of linear equations have
maximal rank, the solution gives a point $P_2$ that coincide, as
a projective point, to $P_1$, which is impossible. Hence we consider the
case in which the matrix of the linear system do not have maximal rank.
This condition implies that $\scl{P_1}{P_1} = 0$, hence $P_1$ is on the
isotropic conic. W.l.o.g.\ we can assume $P_1 = (1: \iii: 0)$ and again 
we can determine $P_2$ such $\delta_1(P_1, P_2, P_4) = 0$ and
$\delta_1(P_1, P_2, P_6)$ are zero. The matrix $\Phi(P_1, P_4, P_5, P_6, P_7)$
must have rank $9$ or smaller, then either
$\delta_2(P_1, P_4, P_5, P_6, P_7)=0$ or $\delta_1(P_1, P4, P_6) = 0$. IN
the first case, we have a $\delta_2$ condition among the points, hence
we assume $\delta_1(P_1, P_4, P_6) = 0$. Solving this equation and
considering the corresponding points, we get that either
$\delta_2(P_1, P_2, P_3, P_6, P_7) = 0$ or
$\delta_2(P_1, P_2, P_3, P_4, P_5)=0$.
\end{proof}

From the avobe lemma, we have that configuration (3) can be
realized only by a $\delta_2$ condition (a meno dei casi particolari
da inserire bene @@@).

Here we list the ways in which we can obtain configuration (3)

\underline{Configuration (4)}. It holds:

configuration (4) and such that are eigenpoints of a cubic, then the
cubic has $7$ eigenpoints which are in configuration (8). In particular,
configuration (4) is not realizable.
\end{prop}
\begin{proof}
%% il file config4.sage contiene la dimostrazione
We know that configuration cannot be obtained from a rank 8 $V$-configuration, 
hence we have to study the case $\delta_1(P_1, P_2, P_4) = 0$,
$\delta_1(P_2, P_1, P_4) = 0$ and $\delta_1(P_4, P_1, P_2) = 0$,
which is not difficult.

\section{The locus of forms with positive-dimensional eigenscheme}

\begin{prop}
Assume that $\dim \Eig{f} = 1$ and that the one-dimensional component of $\Eig{f}$ is a line~$L$.
Then $L \subseteq \mathrm{Sing}(f)$.
\end{prop}
\begin{proof}
Assume by contradiction that
%
\[
 L \subseteq {\overline{R(f)}}.
\]
%
We observe that if $L \subseteq V(f)$, then $L\subset \iso$, by Proposition ....
This is impossible since $\iso$ is irreducible.

So consider the scheme-theoretic intersection
%
\[
Z:= L \cap \iso,
\]
%
If $Z \subset R(f)$, then $Z \subset V(f)$ by Proposition \ref{pro: relation eigenpoints - tangent space to the isotroquadric}. Since $L \not \subset V(f)$, residually $L$ intersects $V(f)$ in a point. Since such a point is also an eigenpoint and it can't be regular, it is necessarily a singular point of $V(f)$. This gives a contradiction, since every line passing through a singular point has intersection multiplicity $\ge 2$ with $V(f)$.
Finally, assume that $Z = p_1 + p_2$ as a divisor on~$\iso$, with $p_1 \in R(f)$ and $p_2\in {\overline {R(f)}} \setminus R(f)$. The necessarily $p_2 \in \mathrm{Sing}(f)$, so that residually to~$Z$ the line~$L$ intersects~$V(f)$ in~$p_2$. Therefore $V(f)$ has a singular point $p_2$ on $\iso$ and $V(f)$ intersect tangentially~$\iso$ in~$p_1$.
The examples show that this never happens ...
\end{proof}

\begin{prop}\label{p2}
Let $C = V(f) \subset \p^2$ be a cubic curve.
Assume that $\dim \Eig{f} = 1$ and that the $1$-dimensional component is a line~$L$.
Then the residual subscheme $Z := \mathrm{Res}_L \bigl( \Eig{f} \bigr)$ in~$\Eig{f}$ with respect to~$L$ is zero-dimensional of degree~$3$ if $\dim \Lambda = 2$, or of degree~$4$, if $\dim \Lambda = 1$.
\end{prop}
\begin{proof}
Since $G_1$, $G_2$ and $G_3$ have a common linear component~$L$, by writing
\[
G_i=L \ H_i, \quad i=1,2,3
\]
we have that the residual subscheme $Z = \mathrm{Res}_L \bigl( \Eig{f} \bigr)$ is a quasi complete intersection
determined by the polynomials $H_1$, $H_2$ and $H_3$; indeed, we recall that $\mathcal{I}_{Z, \p^2} = \mathcal{I}_{\Eig{f}), \p^2} (-1)$.

Let us assume $\dim \Lambda = 2 = \dim \p \bigl( \left\langle H_1,H_2,H_3 \right\rangle \bigr)$.
So we have an exact sequence
\[
 0 \to \mathcal{G} \to \oo_{\p^2} (-2) \oplus \oo_{\p^2} (-2) \oplus \oo_{\p^2} (-2) \to \mathcal{I}_{Z,\p^2} \to 0 \,,
\]
where $\mathcal{G}$ is a rank two reflexive sheaf by \cite[Proposition 1]{Hartshorne1980}.
But on a smooth surface reflexive implies locally free (see \cite[Example~1.1.6]{Huybrechts2010}),
so $\mathcal{G}$ is a rank two vector bundle.

Next we observe that the two independent
syzygies between the generators $G_i$ give rise to the syzygies:
\[
x_2\ H_1 - x_1\ H_2 + x_0\ H_3=0, \qquad \partial_2 f\ H_1 - \partial_1 f \ H_2 +\partial_0 f \ H_3=0,
\]
which occur in degrees $3$ and $4$. We claim that the two relations are independent, again,
otherwise the $G_i$'s would be identically zero. So we apply \cite[Proposition~12]{Ellia2020}, and we have that $\mathcal {G}$ splits. Observe that as $c_1(\mathcal {I}_{Z,\p^2})=0$, we have $c_1(\mathcal {G})=-6$. Moreover, there is no syzygy in degree $2$, since
otherwise the $H_i$ would be linearly dependent, so the $G_i$ would belong to a pencil, which we excluded.

It follows that the splitting of $\mathcal{G}$ is of the form
%
\[
\mathcal{G} \cong \oo_{\p^2} (-3) \oplus \oo_{\p^2} (-3) \,.
\]
%
We get the free resolution of the ideal sheaf:
%
\[
0\to \oo_{\p^2} (-3)\oplus \oo_{\p^2} (-3) \to 3\oo_{\p^2} (-2)\to \mathcal {I}_{Z,\p^2} \to 0 \,.
\]
%
Moreover
%
\[
c_2 (\mathcal{I}_{Z,\p^2} ) = c_2 \bigl( 3\oo_{\p^2}(-2) \bigr) - c_2 (\mathcal{G}) = 12 - 9 = 3 \,,
\]
%
and $h^0 \bigl( \mathcal{I}_{Z,\p^2}(1) \bigr) = 0$.

Finally, assume $\dim \Lambda =1 =\dim \p \bigl( \left\langle H_1, H_2, H_3 \right\rangle \bigr)$.
Then $Z = \mathrm{Res}_L \bigl( \Eig{f} \bigr)$ is the complete intersection of two conics.
\end{proof}


\begin{es}
Consider
\[
f(x_0,x_1,x_2)=x_0^2 (x_1 - x_2)
\]
(Example~\eqref{item: ternary cubic, no regular eigenpoints} with $t=i$).
We have $L=x_0$,
\[
H_1=x_0^2-2x_1^2+2x_1 x_2, \quad H_2= 2x_2^2-x_0^2-2x_1 x_2, \quad H_3= 2x_1x_2-2x_2^2-x_0x_1 \,.
\]
The two syzygies in degree~$3$ are:
\[
x_2 \, H_1 - x_1 \, H_2 + x_0 \, H_3 = 0, \quad x_0 \, H_2 + 2(x_1+x_2) \, H_3 + x_0 \, H_1 = 0.
\]
Finally, $Z= \{ (0:1:1),(2:1:-1),(-2:1:-1)\}$. Observe that one point is on the singular line $x_0=0$
and that the Jacobian scheme is non reduced, it consists of a line with an embedded point.
\end{es}

\begin{rmk}
Assume $\dim E(f) =1$ and that the $1$-dimensional component is an irreducible conic $\tilde Q$. Let $Q$ be the isotropic quadric. Then we have the following possible cases:
\begin{itemize}
\item $\tilde Q = Q$. It seems that this never happens.
\item set $Z:= \tilde Q \cap Q$. Then $Z\subset R(f)$ , so $V(f)$ is tangent to $Q$ in four points.
\item $Z$ consists of one singular point for $V(f)$ and one or two regular eigenpoints.
\item $Z$ consists of two singular points for $V(f)$.
\item $Z$ consists of a triple point for $V(f)$, with one common tangent with $Q$.
\end{itemize}
